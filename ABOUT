What is PLplot?

PLplot is relatively small, portable, freely distributable plotting library, 
that is rich enough to satisfy most users.  It has a wide range of plot types 
including line (linear, log), contour, 3D, fill, and it supports unicode text
so that plots can be labeled in pretty much any language.  The package is 
designed to make it easy to quickly get graphical output; only a handful of 
function calls are typically required. For more advanced use, virtually all 
aspects of plotting are configurable.
