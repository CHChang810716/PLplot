	* configure.ac: only run AM_PATH_PYTHON(1.5) if python is enabled.

	* bindings/Makefile.am: if enable_tcl is not yes, then no attempt is
	  made to create pkgIndex.tcl. This should fix the problems Joao was
	  having in an environment without tcl.  Later this should be
	  changed to depend on the more general has_tcl instead, but AWI's
	  opinion is that has_tcl is broken in sysloc.in at the moment so we
	  will stick with depending on enable_tcl for a while.

	* src/plcore.c: Change from lt_dlopen to lt_dlopenext for more
	  cross-platform suffix generality.

	* sysloc.in: has_tcl is now set to enable_tcl.

	* bindings/Makefile.am: pkgIndex.tcl now only built if tcl enabled.

	* utils/Makefile.am: pltcl now only built if tcl enabled.

2002-12-07  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* drivers/Makefile.am: Make tk and tkwin static drivers work. This
	  completes the static drivers configuration.

	* bindings/t*/pkgIndex.tcl.in: search for Pltk and Plplotter entry
	  points in libplplot if a search in the dynamic drivers fails.
	  This is required for static drivers since in that case the entry 
	  points (and drivers) are put in libplplot.
	  
	* PROBLEMS: reorganization and updating to help set our priorities
	  for what must be accomplished before the next release.

2002-12-06  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

        * Configure test executables in examples for c++, f77, and tk.  make
	  check builds the uninstalled c, c++, f77, and tk examples fine,
	  and plplot-test.sh works with these uninstalled examples with some
	  limitations that are discussed on list.

	* Make all static drivers (except for tk and tkwin whose
	  implementation will be more complicated) work using the automake
	  convenience library approach.

2002-12-05  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* Configure test executables in examples/c/Makefile.am
	
	* Clean up Makefile.am files and also switch from LIBADD to LDFLAGS
	  for interlibrary dependencies as suggested by documentation.
	  
	* Change fortran and C++ driver names to libplplotf77 and libplplotcxx
	  because of name-clash concerns.

2002-12-04  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* Begin configuration of octave using autotools.  plplot_octave.oct
	  builds and installs, but no other part of octave is done yet.
	  Note this and all future autotools work is being done on the MAIN
	  branch.
	  
	* plplot_octave.oct build with Joao's recent gcc 3.2.x fix.

	* (mostly) finish configuration of octave using autotools.  Over
	  to Joao now to sort out why the installed p7.m and p15.m examples
	  don't work and why none of the x??.m examples work.


2002-12-03  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* With a lot of work required to work around state problems in the
	  repository, merged the AT branch into MAIN.  Welcome to the world
	  of autotools configuration on our MAIN branch!

2002-12-02  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* drivers/Makefile.am for AT branch: instead of using the
	  concatanation of all compiler flags for all dynamic drivers, apply
	  only those compiler flags that are appropriate to each dynamic
	  driver.  This makes a huge reduction in the command line when
	  gnome driver flags are involved, and probably saves significant
	  computer time as well when you avoid searching all those gnome
	  header directories for each dynamic driver.
	  
	* test/Makefile.am, etc for AT branch.  Bring test directory under
	  autotools control. Result is that plplot-test.sh runs in the
	  installed examples directory and gives identical results with the
	  MAIN branch (except in a few cases where there is version skew
	  between the examples since AT was branched from MAIN).

2002-12-01  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* Finish (nearly) all the dynamic driver builds for AT. Checked that
	  gnome, png, xfig, ntk all worked.  Also, package require Plplotter
	  (which accesses the tkwin_drv.so shared object) also works, and
	  -dev tkwin works (although it simply returns the usual error
	  message about no widget being available since this is not a
	  stand-alone driver).  As far as I know, the only driver that still
	  has errors under AT is tk.

2002-11-30  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* Finish AT libplplottcltk.so* build when itcl and tk are enabled.

	* bindings/tk for AT: build and install plserver and *.tcl, *.itk,
	  and palette (*.pal) files.

	* acinclude.m4 copied (again) from cf/aclocal.m4 for AT branch to
	  pick up all the autoconf 2.5.3 changes.

2002-11-29  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* Finish AT tcl binding.  These are only small fairly
	  non-consequential refinements that I did while trying to debug the
	  extended search problem (which had a simple solution which I will
	  discuss on list).

	* Prepare for the AT change in bindings/tk and bindings/tk-x-plat 
	  by dropping "plplot/" from the #include statements in the 
	  source files.
	
2002-11-28  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* AT build of libplplottcl (including a substantial reorganization
	  of configure.in).

	* AT build of utilities plrender, pltek, and pltcl.

	* AT reorganize src/Makefile.am, but no substantive changes.

2002-11-27  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* Creation of python extension modules now works.  Replaced the
	  setup.py method (which had some cross-platform question marks)
	  with a libtools method.

	* Fixed build of xwin_drv.so so it links to libplplot.  Without this
	  the python examples won't work with the xwin driver.
	
	* Install of python examples including new plplot_python_start.py
	  which is configured to make accessible to python the
	  directory which contains the installed plplot python extensions
	  (assuming that might not be in the standard system location).

	* Fixed single precision bugs in bindings/c++/Makefile.am and
	  bindings/f77/Makefile.am.

2002-11-26  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* Support for examples/c examples/c++ and examples/f77 on AT
	  branch.
	* Adopt Maurice's idea of initializing libltdl in pllib_init().
	* Makefile.examples using plplot_libtool, c works
	* c++ works (required a fix to linking of libplcxx consistent
	  with hierarchical linking model.)
	* f77 works (required a fix to linking of libplf77 consistent
	  with hierarchical linking model.)

2002-11-25  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* Makefile.am files: some reorganization, but mostly adding
	  EXTRA_DIST macros so the distributed tarball generated by
	  make dist has everything it needs.
	* configure.in and /bindings/f77/Makefile.am: Cross-platform 
	  glitches fixed for solaris.

2002-11-24  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* Add plConfig.h to installed headers.
	* Remove aclocal.m4 from cvs control (was stale cvs deleted file which
	  is automatically generated in any case with an up-to-date version
	  using ./bootstrap.sh).
	* Makefile.am files: add support for libltdl.
	* include/disptab.h: New PLDispatchInit typedef consistent with lt_ptr.
	* include/plcore.h: Change dlhand type.
	* src/plcore.c: Switch from dlopen API to libltdl API (a fair number
	  of changes because of new types for dlopen and dlsym equivalents,
	  and need for lt_dlinit() and lt_dlexit() calls which I chose to
	  make for each stream created and destroyed.)

2002-11-23  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* FREETYPEINCCMD and FREETYPELIBCMD

2002-11-22  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* Initial creation (from resurrected AM-LT merged into 20021122
	  MAIN HEAD) and checkin of AT branch.  Details given on plplot_devel 
	  list.
	* .cvsignore files: convenience changes.
	* Makefile.am: reorder src first, then drivers (since dynamic 
	  drivers depend on src).  Will take care of static drivers later.
	* acconfig.h: ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS DRIVERS_DB, and switch the old
	  drivers list to a new complete devices list.
	* acconfig.h: ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS DRIVERS_DB, and switch drivers list
	  to complete devices list.
	* configure.in: incorporate HEAD static and dynamic driver handling
	  from old cf/configure.in. Changed DATA_DIR back to current standard
	  ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS, DRIVERS_DB. Current standard for dynamic driver
	  names.
	* drivers/Makefile.am: Current static drivers don't work, but
	  added working versions of xwin and ps dynamic drivers.
	* drivers/ps.c: PLPLOT_VERSION ==> VERSION
	* examples/c/*.c examples/c/*.h: change to old include style without
	  the "plplot/".
	* src/Makefile.am: completed list of files to include in libplplot;
	  hacked in -lm -ldl -lfreetype (freetype should be option); and
	  disabled use of convenience library for static drivers (to be
	  revisited later).
	* */Makefile.am: change to LGPL license as agreed with Rafael
	* COPYING: copy from COPYING.LIB, the text of the LGPL   Otherwise, 
	  automake generates a GPL License file which is not appropriate for 
	  LGPLed PLplot.
