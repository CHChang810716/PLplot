	* Creation of python extension modules now works.  Replaced the
	  setup.py method (which had some cross-platform question marks)
	  with a libtools method.

	* Fixed build of xwin_drv.so so it links to libplplot.  Without this
	  the python examples won't work with the xwin driver.
	
	* Install of python examples including new plplot_python_start.py
	  which is configured to make accessible to python the
	  directory which contains the installed plplot python extensions
	  (assuming that might not be in the standard system location).

2002-11-26  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* Support for examples/c examples/c++ and examples/f77 on AT
	  branch.
	* Adopt Maurice's idea of initializing libltdl in pllib_init().
	* Makefile.examples using plplot_libtool, c works
	* c++ works (required a fix to linking of libplcxx consistent
	  with hierarchical linking model.)
	* f77 works (required a fix to linking of libplf77 consistent
	  with hierarchical linking model.)

2002-11-25  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* Makefile.am files: some reorganization, but mostly adding
	  EXTRA_DIST macros so the distributed tarball generated by
	  make dist has everything it needs.
	* configure.in and /bindings/f77/Makefile.am: Cross-platform 
	  glitches fixed for solaris.

2002-11-24  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* Add plConfig.h to installed headers.
	* Remove aclocal.m4 from cvs control (was stale cvs deleted file which
	  is automatically generated in any case with an up-to-date version
	  using ./bootstrap.sh).
	* Makefile.am files: add support for libltdl.
	* include/disptab.h: New PLDispatchInit typedef consistent with lt_ptr.
	* include/plcore.h: Change dlhand type.
	* src/plcore.c: Switch from dlopen API to libltdl API (a fair number
	  of changes because of new types for dlopen and dlsym equivalents,
	  and need for lt_dlinit() and lt_dlexit() calls which I chose to
	  make for each stream created and destroyed.)

2002-11-23  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* FREETYPEINCCMD and FREETYPELIBCMD

2002-11-22  Alan W. Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>

	* Initial creation (from resurrected AM-LT merged into 20021122
	  MAIN HEAD) and checkin of AT branch.  Details given on plplot_devel 
	  list.
	* .cvsignore files: convenience changes.
	* Makefile.am: reorder src first, then drivers (since dynamic 
	  drivers depend on src).  Will take care of static drivers later.
	* acconfig.h: ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS DRIVERS_DB, and switch the old
	  drivers list to a new complete devices list.
	* acconfig.h: ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS DRIVERS_DB, and switch drivers list
	  to complete devices list.
	* configure.in: incorporate HEAD static and dynamic driver handling
	  from old cf/configure.in. Changed DATA_DIR back to current standard
	  ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS, DRIVERS_DB. Current standard for dynamic driver
	  names.
	* drivers/Makefile.am: Current static drivers don't work, but
	  added working versions of xwin and ps dynamic drivers.
	* drivers/ps.c: PLPLOT_VERSION ==> VERSION
	* examples/c/*.c examples/c/*.h: change to old include style without
	  the "plplot/".
	* src/Makefile.am: completed list of files to include in libplplot;
	  hacked in -lm -ldl -lfreetype (freetype should be option); and
	  disabled use of convenience library for static drivers (to be
	  revisited later).
	* */Makefile.am: change to LGPL license as agreed with Rafael
	* COPYING: copy from COPYING.LIB, the text of the LGPL   Otherwise, 
	  automake generates a GPL License file which is not appropriate for 
	  LGPLed PLplot.
