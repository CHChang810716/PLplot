	* Initial creation (from resurrected AM-LT merged into 20021122 MAIN HEAD)
	and checkin of AT branch.  Details given on plplot_devel list.
	* .cvsignore files: convenience changes.
	* Makefile.am: reorder src first, then drivers (since dynamic 
	drivers depend on src).  Will take care of static drivers later.
	* acconfig.h: ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS DRIVERS_DB, and switch drivers list
	to complete devices list.
	* configure.in: incorporate HEAD static and dynamic driver handling
	from old cf/configure.in. Changed DATA_DIR back to current standard
	ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS, DRIVERS_DB. Current standard for dynamic driver
	names.
	* drivers/Makefile.am: Current static drivers don't work, but
	added working versions of xwin and ps dynamic drivers.
	* drivers/ps.c: PLPLOT_VERSION ==> VERSION
	* examples/c/*.c examples/c/*.h: change to old include style without
	the "plplot/".
	* src/Makefile.am: completed list of files to include in libplplot;
	hacked in -lm -ldl -lfreetype (freetype should be option); and
	disabled use of convenience library for static drivers (to be
	revisited later).
