Fix build-system bug in configuration and installation of
stylesheet.css for the case where the documentation is prebuilt.

Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> by running

scripts/make_tarball.sh -c -i /tmp/plplot_install
find /tmp/plplot-dist-prep -name "*.out" |xargs grep -i error

and browsing the resulting documentation that was installed from the
generated preliminary version of the release tarball in
/tmp/plplot_install/share/doc/plplot/html while looking carefully
for stylesheet issues.

Drop -t and -w options and modify script to create a release tarball
from the parent directory of wherever the script resides.  Thus, it can
create preliminary test tarballs from the local copy of svn trunk
(where this script resides) or a final release tarball from a local
copy of the appropriate tags release directory (where this script also
resides).

In the interests of committing what I have on my disk to the svn
repository, commit the current snapshot of build_projects for this
PLplot release. Note, it has actually been a while since I have been
working on this subproject so this result should be considered
experimental and may not even currently work.  But at least
it preserves a snapshot of my work and will provide a starting
point for the next time I work on build_projects.

Furthermore, because of the routine cairo_win32_surface_create is missing from the cairo library, we can not build the wincairo device. For now this is turned off under Cygwin.

Move creation of jadetex.cfg from a place that is always executed
to the appropriate Boolean block.

Do not remove info directory that is initially created at cmake time.
This solves a bug when the info target is reinvoked at make time after
a change to the docbook source.

Specifically ignore environment variable DESTDIR when xmlto --with-fop
is invoked.  This works around a bug in xmlto which (on Debian at
least) craps out when DESTDIR is specified.

Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> using the
-DBUILD_DOC=ON -DBUILD_DOX_DOC=ON cmake options and the install
target invoked in the following ways:

make -j4 install
make DESTDIR=whatever -j4 install

Change funcsynopsis style to ansi and configure widths of the
resulting html table to auto (which gives nice looking spacing for the
arguments).  These changes make the new XML/XSL backend tools produce
the html form of the API chapter with a style comparable to what was
produced with the deprecated SGML/DSSSL backend tools.

Make some progress toward the goal of representing the overlined "S" and
underlined "freq" in S(freq) correctly represented in html.  However,
the final step of inserting the correct form of html needs additional
XSLT expertise that I currently don't have as mentioned in the
/plplotdoc-html.xsl.in comments.  So the result validates
fine but is currently rendered as a blank.

So aside from this one overline/underline issue (which appears just
before the Table of Greek letters), the complete html
results for the new XML/XSL backend tools are better (Table of Greek
letters) or similar (API chapter) to what they were before for the
deprecated SGML/DSSSL backend tools.

Improve CMake logic for building DocBook documentation.

Replace destroying and creating the inline.ent symlink idea for
various forms of the inline entities with properly configured info,
print, and html variants of plplotdoc-?.xml. This change removes the
dependencies of the various backend documentation between each other
since there is no longer the parallel build race condition to be
avoided for the various kinds of inline.ent symlinks.

Non-configured *.xml and *.ent files are referred to directly in the
source tree rather than as symlinks in the build tree.  This makes
establishing file dependencies much more straightforward.

Drop if(PERL_FOUND) logic since that is redundant.  (Earlier in build
process, BUILD_DOC is set to OFF if perl cannot be found.)

Use actual Linux filesystem commands (like mv) rather than relying on
FindUnixCommands.cmake to define the ${MV} equivalent of mv.  (ToDo,
replace Linux filesystem commmands used for the documentation build
such as "mv" with their cmake -E equivalents just on general
principles.)

Use slightly improved naming conventions for intermediate files created by info
target.

That has now been rectified with revision 12481 so the fake system
identifiers imposed by the perl scripts are no longer needed, and, in
fact, they must be removed because they conflict with the real system

Remove \$ENV{DESTDIR} references from install(CODE...) commands and
also reformat those commands to make them more human-readable.

Note, these are all examples of where file(INSTALL...) is used inside
install(CODE...).  According to the documentation file(INSTALL...) is
the workhorse signature normall used for install commands so it is
reasonable to infer that file(INSTALL...) already does its own
\$ENV{DESTDIR} handling.  Anyhow, it turns out our own use of
\$ENV{DESTDIR} is redundant and causes an error (double use of DESTDIR
for the docbook documentation) found by Orion Poplawski and which I
have confirmed.  Note, for all other uses of install(CODE...) that
does not have a call to file(INSTALL...) inside the code fragment
(e.g., doc/CMakeLists.txt) it is necessary to use \$ENV{DESTDIR}.

Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> using the
cmake options -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DBUILD_DOC=ON -DBUILD_DOX_DOC=ON
and "make -j4 DESTDIR=tmp install >& install.out".  The
resulting files (including both doxgen-generated ones and
docbook-generated ones) were all installed to tmp/usr/... in the build_tree
with no double use of DESTDIR and no attempt to install files to /usr.

Sort out all generated catalog issues for the MSYS case.

This gives good results for build_gtk-doc on Linux, but
that build still fails for the MSYS case because of the
entity mangling issue for raw xmlcatalog on that platform
(see https://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2013-January/msg00009.html).
However, for the MSYS case have spot-checked a few of the generated
catalog results with the xmlcatalog_wrapper.sh script, and they
seem fine.  Which seems to indicate that the catalogs generated
by the docbook-x?l packages are fine on MSYS.

Initial commit of a script that makes it convenient to check XML
catalogs on MSYS using the xmlcatalog --shell environment.

With two arguments (with the first a reference to a file assumed to be
a catalog file) this script goes into xmlcatalog shell mode to look up
entities with both the public and system attributes.  Otherwise, it
just falls through to the equivalent raw xmlcatalog command.

The only point of this script is it provides a reasonably convenient
human workaround for the raw xmlcatalog issue on MSYS platforms where
that environment mangles entity names on the command line (it
interprets them as a path and does some substitution into the entity
which completely messes it up, see
https://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2013-January/msg00009.html).  I
have not been able to figure out how to make this script respond
identically to what the raw xmlcatalog command should actually be
doing if the entities didn't get mangled. So this script is only for
convenient human use to check catalogs, but cannot be used in scripts
itself as a replacement for raw xmlcatalog.

warning when build_projects is configured.

Implement a build_plplot_lite target (which disables wxwidgets, qt,
and cairo device drivers and which therefore has fewer dependencies and
builds and tests 5 times as fast).

Meanwhile, the build_plplot target now has properly implemented
wxwidgets and pango build configuration dependencies, i.e., wxwidgets
and pango and their dependencies will be built first, then plplot
which will depend on those built and installed results.

Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> using both the
build_plplot_lite (5 minutes) and build_plplot (25 minutes) targets on Linux.

Add ragel build configuration.  This is the last required build
configuration (other than obvious build tools and libXft) that the
jhbuild configuration data indicates is required for pango and all
its dependencies.  So in theory the build of pango should also work
on MSYS, but undoubtedly there are other dependencies that the
jhbuild configuration files currently fail to identify.

Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> by running the
update_added_packages.sh script to automatically generate/regenerate all added
build_configurations (which now includes ragel) and afterward running the
build_harfbuzz target (which indirectly runs the build_ragel target) on
Linux.

Implement AUTOTOOLS_PARALLEL_BUILD option which defaults to ON (and
which works well on Linux).  It might be useful to set this to OFF for
MSYS/Wine builds because that reduces some strain caused by running
many large libtool bash scripts simultaneously and which appears to
pop some error boxes from time to time under MSYS wine.

Reduce the number of builds that are directly configured since their
dependencies indirectly bring in the rest.

Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux using
the build_wxwidgets, build_pango, and build_plplot targets.  These tests
are for the recent cumulation of commits up to this one.  wxwidgets
built in parallel with no issues, but because of a minor PATH issue
was ignored by the plplot build.  The pango build (and the build of all its many
dependencies) showed no issues and finished in 7.5 minutes.  The
PLplot build (and all its specific small dependencies) had no issues
(except for ignoring the wxwidgets build results and a few additional
dependency issues to be discussed).  The
cairo device driver was linked with all the pango-related libraries that
were built and the cairo non-interactive devices tested well.  Limited
tests of the cairo non-interactive devices also seemed fine.

In sum, this is a breakthrough for the build_packages project where
for the first time with this project we have built essentially the
latest version of pango and its dependencies without issues, and used
those libraries to produce excellent results for the PLplot cairo
devices on Linux.

ToDo: the libfreetype and libpng dependencies are not yet part of
build_packages so the above PLplot results used the system versions of
those instead on Linux.  There may be other dependencies that are
required (to be discussed on the plplot-devel list) as well.

Move back to parallel builds in general.  I now have more experience
with autotools type builds on MSYS/Wine, and they all seem to pop
several error boxes (probably due to some Wine-1.6 issue) typically
during runs of the enormous libtool bash script configured for each
project and typically run (twice!) for each compilation.  My
hypothesis now is the parallel builds are putting extreme pressure on
bash running those libtool scripts so the number of error boxes that
are popped for MSYS should be reduced if parallel builds are not
allowed for autotools-configured projects.  But I will handle that
with an overall option (see next commit) rather than specifically
turning off parallel builds for each separate autotools project.

all dependencies which don't have a build configuration yet) and
configuring the configure script arguments and the make command

Add template results for dependencies and extra CFLAGS.  libffi has

should have no effect for libffi.

Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> using the
build_libffi target (or build_glib target that depends on the
build_libffi target) for both Linux and "MSYS Makefiles" on Wine. In
the latter case there was a popup error box with the last command
executed being the install script. But when I ran that command by hand
afterwards everything worked fine.  I suspect this intermittent error
is due to a race condition for parallel builds so I will try turning
off parallel builds for libffi for future tests.

ToDo: 
This change works fine on Linux, but for MSYS/Windows there is an
additional CMake/libarchive issue that leads to an error which I
initially spotted for MSYS/Wine which is now confirmed by Brad King on
MSYS/Microsoft Windows.  This issue has now been fixed privately by
Brad King by importing the latest libarchive into CMake, and he plans
to incorporate that change into the mainstream git version of CMake
for eventual release.  As a workaround until that happens, my next
move is to replace cmake -E tar <options> by the equivalent tar
<options> command in ExternalProject.cmake. That workaround plus the
current change should finally allow unpacking of *.tar.xz files to
work properly for ExternalProject_Add, and that projected breakthrough
is expected to have a large impact on the build_projects project since
essentially _all_ GTK source project tarballs are in *.tar.xz form.

Initial commit of the ffi build configuration.  libffi is a hard
dependency of modern glib which is not mentioned in the jhbuild
configuration of glib.  So adding this build configuration for
libffi is a workaround for that jhbuild configuration bug for glib.

Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> using the
build_ffi target for both the "Unix Makefiles" generator on Linux and
the "MSYS Makefiles" generator on Wine.  Note the latter was a factor
of 35 (!) slower than the former.  (5 minutes versus 9 seconds.) My
guess is most of this extra time is taken up running the configure
script.  That is, that part of the build is strongly subject to
startup latency costs for Wine so that for builds of much larger
autotooled packages, the Wine slowdown factor will generally be
substantially smaller than 35.

only for the case of shared libraries and either WIN32 or Cygwin.

We do this for Cygwin only because CMake currently does not use the
-rpath linker capability (which apparently works according to
anecedotal evidence) on that platform.  But we should review this
Cygwin decision in the future if/when CMake changes to use the -rpath
linker capability on that platform.

Follow the build of CMake itself so that the initial order of commands is

cmake_minimum_required(...
set(CMAKE_LEGACY_CYGWIN_WIN32 0)
project(...

This reordering should (hopefully) solve a current Cygwin issue where
there is a warning about CMAKE_LEGACY_CYGWIN_WIN32 not being set.

This reordering means that the variable CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME is not
defined when cmake_minimum_required is called so we must use the same
minimum CMake version for all platforms.  In retrospect this is a good
thing since the value of the minimum version sets a number of CMake
policies, and we want those policies (how CMake logic is interpreted)
to be identical on all platforms.

I also took this opportunity to update the minimum version from 2.8.2
on Linux and 2.8.6 on all other platforms to a uniform 2.8.9.  I chose
that minimum to be consistent with the CMake version available on
Debian Wheezy (released a few months ago, and typically more
conservative about CMake versions than other modern Linux
distributions).  What this means is modern Linux distribution users
(and presumably users of modern Mac versions) should be able to build
PLplot without having to build or download a modern CMake version as
well.  As always, Windows users and legacy Linux distribution users
will have to download a binary CMake or build CMake with
a version that satisifies the version requirements (currently 2.8.9).

Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> using the
install target (for -DBUILD_TEST=ON) and also by running ctest.
Note, I view this testing as the minimum acceptable for such a
fundamental build-system change where some of the CMake policies
(interpretations of CMake logic) have been updated on Linux from those
policies in effect for 2.8.2 to the policies in effect for 2.8.9.

Convert from *.cmake form to *.in form for all files configured by
CMake.  From now on that means the *.cmake form is reserved for

This change should remove the last historical traces of autotools from
our project.  Historically we could not use the *.in form for certain
files configured by CMake because those files already existed at that
time as autotools configurable files.  But the autotools form of
configurable *.in files were removed some time ago so that allows the
chance to use that form of name now for all CMake-configurable files
now.

Initial commit of script to parse jhbuild xml file produced by
gtk_xml_recursive_process.py (which combines included chain of jhbuild
xml files into one file).

Currently the principal function of the script, parse_jhbuild only
has the logic tested where if_dependencies is True (i.e., where dependencies
are being recursively followed), and that test on real jhbuild data showed
a circular dependency which lead to infinite depths in the recursion.

So some method of detecting circular dependencies and erroring out
must be implemented, and the logic for the alternative straight
printout of values without following the dependencies must be extended
a bit as well.

The overview is the stdout from this script will be used as input for
another python script (still being designed) to transform the single
complete xml file into build_projects configuration files.

This should be the final version of this script for gtk-3.4.1, but it
is likely changes will have to be made for other versions of gtk
modules (when we move to those) since some exact syntax assumptions
are made that are correct for 3.4.1 jhbuild module files, but might
not be correct for other versions.  

Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> by running

./gtk_xml_recursive_process.py /home/software/pango_stack/jhbuild/modulesets/3.4.1/gnome-apps-3.4.1.modules

This command followed all the includes.  That is, all *.modules files
in that directory were included in the output to stdout as measured by
some spot checking and "wc -l" line count results that jibed with the
total line count for *.modules files in that directory (if you account
for three dropped include lines and two head lines and one tail line
that are dropped from the included files).

Implement a BUILD_THE_BUILDTOOLS option.

When this variable is set to ON with -DBUILD_THE_BUILDTOOLS=ON, this
puts build_projects in a special mode to build and install only a
small list of buildtools.  Only cmake is on that list of buildtools
for now that are built with this option.  cmake is built with the
bootstrap method to cut the dependence on the binary version of cmake
that is used to configure build_projects in the
-DBUILD_THE_BUILDTOOLS=ON case.

The idea is once the buildtools list of packages is built with this
special option, then you can put those buildtools on the PATH and use
them from then on in normal builds of build_packages to reduce the
reliance on downloaded binaries for all results.

Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> using the
build_all target for the "Unix Makefiles" generator on Linux and the
"MSYS Makefiles" generator on (the Wine version of) Windows.  Note
these were just successful build tests, and the resulting
cmake-2.8.11.1 binary in each case has not been tested (yet) by using
it for builds of other software.  But all subsequent tests will be

The previous method (relying on rpath) does not seem to work for Cygwin.

Note: this does not solve the problem that under Cygwin a path "c:/tcl/include" is returned, even while these header files are available under "/usr/include". Therefore the build is not completely smooth yet.

Attempted PLplot build ran into some errors for the "MinGW Makefiles"
generator for the libharu dependency of PLplot.  So temporarily drop wxwidgets (to save time)
and plplot (to avoid this error) and do full test of remaining 5
builds (for libqhull, libharu, ndiff, ligagg, and shapelib) for all
combinations of generators.  

Note, one of these tests was for "NMake
Makefiles JOM" for both C and C++ projects so I had to propagate
CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER (as well as the equivalent C and RC variables) for that case to work around the issues between
this generator and the MinGW suite of compilers.

All these tests were fine as measured by
grep -i warn build_all.out |grep -v "passing argument" |less
grep -i error build_all.out |grep -v "but argument is of type" |less

So this large number of tests should provide a good benchmark for when I reenable plplot again.

Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> using the
"build_all" target for the "MSYS Makefiles", "MinGW Makefiles", "NMake
Makefiles JOM" (with CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER. etc., workaround), and "Ninja" generators on a wine-git version near
wine-1.6.0-rc1, and for the "Unix Makefiles" and "Ninja" generators on

Switch to slow but reliable non-parallel builds because parallel
builds for wxwidgets have proved to be unreliable both historically
and recently (presumably due to some parallel build race conditions
for wxwidgets that intermittently produce bad results depending on who
wins the race).

Use the APPEND signature of add_custom_command for custom steps in
updating the software for each of the build configurations. This
change greatly simplifies the CMake logic and satisfies the stringent
dependency checks done by the CMake "Ninja" generator.

Use the env command for all configuration, build, test, and install
steps.

Reorganize the CMake logic for the overall project including a build_all
target to build all configured projects.

Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> using the
build_all target for "Unix Makefiles" and "Ninja" generators on Linux and
the "MSYS Makefiles", "MinGW Makefiles", and "Ninja" generators on the
Wine version of Windows.

Use cache variable to set BUILD_SHARED_LIBS rather than ordinary

Change from old logic (which forced static library build for
most Windows cases) to forced static library build only
for the combination of Windows and ninja generator.  This
is only a temporary measure to work around a ninja generator bug
on Windows for the combination of shared libraries and using
the same name kernel ("qhull" in this case) for an executable
and shared library.

Reorganize some of the CMake logic.

Replaced all temporary downloads with actual downloads since most of
these build subprojects are thoroughly debugged.  During the test
of this change discovered that the download of the libqhull-2010.1 snapshot
was actually a different snapshot (~4 months later) than the download
I had collected before with this same filename.  So I had to change
the associated MD5sum accordingly.  Furthermore, the latest "2010.1"
version of libqhull continues to build without issues.

Add faux PLplot build which for now just takes care of PLplot build
dependencies for the "Build Projects" project without actually
building PLplot

Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> for both Linux
and MinGW/MSYS/Wine platforms using the build_plplot target.

N.B. from the qhull notes, the gcc option -f-no-strict-aliasing must
be used for qset.c for 2010.1 This only matters if you use -O2, -O3, or
-Os. I haven't decided whether to bother with this or try to use the
latest libqhull instead where this restriction has been removed.

This is the ExternalProject.cmake file from CMake2.8.10.2 with all

workaround to CMake bug http://www.cmake.org/Bug/view.php?id=14020
where cmake uses a doubly deprecated method of updating the
modification times of files to the nearest truncated second.
This one-second errors in the modification times for timestamp
files used for ExternalProject can wreak havoc with make decisions
about updating files, and replacing cmake -E touch with touch
in ExternalProject.cmake fixes this issue.  But this file
should be deleted and the CMake version of ExternalProject.cmake
used just as soon as there is a bug fix for CMake bug 14020

Solve name clash with HAVE_FREETYPE defined in octave headers by
renaming the PLplot version PL_HAVE_FREETYPE.  This change should
be complete because it was done using a combination of find on
the whole source tree and sed, i.e., using the command

for FILE in $(find -type f |grep -v .svn |xargs grep -l HAVE_FREETYPE); do 
  echo $FILE
  sed -e "s?HAVE_FREETYPE?PL_HAVE_FREETYPE?g" <$FILE >| /tmp/test_software
  \mv /tmp/test_software $FILE
done

One tab was changed afterwards by hand in the output for
cmake/modules/summary.cmake, but otherwise visual inspection
of these changes showed no issues with this find/sed approach
to implement this wholesale change.

This fix corrects a "make install" build bug (cannot find the
libplplotcxx library required by libplplotwxwidgets) for the current
unusual case when the C++ bindings are disabled by default.  The fix
is to disable the libplplotwxwidgets build when the C++ bindings are
not enabled.

I thought it was unusual that libplplotwxwidgets depended on
libplplotcxx rather than libplplot, but I double-checked the code and
it includes plstream.h so that dependence (as indicated all along by
the target_link_libraries command) is correct.

Disable all bindings but ocaml by default to eliminate build breakage

To enable these bindings again by default for their language of
choice, the interested developer should propagate the recent integer
==> double line width changes in the C API for pl*shade*, pllegend,
and plcolorbar to their bindings of choice, make the appropriate
changes in examples 4, 16, 26, and 33 to use the changed API, and test
the result (at least by running the test_noninteractive target) with
the language specifically enabled, e.g., with the -DENABLE_python=ON
option.  If that testing works, then the final step is to enable the
language by default again, and commit your changes.

This fix puts the location (in -L, -l form) of the C++ library
associated with the C++ compiler in the list of library options
contained in the plplotd.pc file configured and installed by our build
system for the case where BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is not true.  For that
unique case alone, the plplotd library turns into a static C++ library
because of the C++ device driver code that is compiled into that
library, and the traditional (i.e., using "make" and pkg-config) build
of the installed examples fails without this fix to the configured
plplotd.pc file.

There are some caveats for this logic.

* The find_library CMake logic assumes the name of the library is
  "stdc++". That is certainly the correct name on Linux.  Other names
  could be added if some other kinds of systems have a different name
  for that library.

* The find_library logic uses PATHS which are determined by parsing
  the results of c++ --verbose --version.  That parsing should only work
  for the extremely specific --verbose --version output of the GCC C++
  compiler, but that is a pretty important case, and I am glad to get
  the traditional build of the installed examples to work again for
  that compiler for the static PLplot library case.

Others should feel free to generalize this logic to different
names for the C++ library and other C++ compilers.

clicking the right mouse key was processed twice (once with mouse

would move to the next and then immediately to the next (or exit if
run out of pages).

Move to floating point pen width for qt devices.  This appears to work
now since calling plwidth(0.01); in example 1 yields extremely thin line results
for a number of different qt devices.

During the course of the testing I found a qt device driver issue
which is the -width option (even -width 100.) appears to have no
effect on line width except to make it fixed at unity. I could not
figure out the cause of this issue.  (Which is why I did my testing by
calling plwidth explicitly from example 1).

Modify the ndiff test script that is created by CMake to include extra
filtering in the Windows case to get rid of cr part of line endings and remove
redundant zeros from exponents to make results more comparable to the
Unix test files.

Test results on MinGW/MSYS/Wine failed in 12 or the 26 cases so instead
of using cmp -s for the tests I used diff to see what those
differences were from the Unix files.  In all cases, the results
were due to minor differences of floating-point noise in results from
ndiff on this platform and on Linux.  In virtually all cases when
the floating-point noise was different between the two platforms, the
Wine platform's noise was slightly larger.  

My working hypothesis to explain those results is that Wine is being
slighty sloppy in how well it retains floating-point precision in
calculations compared to Linux.  A similar test on Microsoft Windows
might confirm or deny that hypothesis.

Implement a test system for ndiff.  All tests that were implemented
for the old build system are available for the new build system as well.
These tests consist of capturing stderr and stdout from
ndiff for 26 different sets of options and files being differenced.
Those stderr and stdout data are then compared (using cmp) with the equivalent
data that was calculated in 2000 with ndiff back then.

I have run this test system with HAVE_DOUBLE 0 and HAVE_GMP 0 and got
perfect results.  Such is not the case (as expected) for HAVE_DOUBLE 1
since on Intel hardware the long double type corresponds to 80-bit floating-point
rather than 128-bit floating-point.  gcc does have options to
provide 128-bit floating point, but ndiff.c code changes would be
required to take advantage of that possibility.  For example, I
think you would need to use the __float128 type which is a gcc extension.

More plcolorbar fixes

- Properly initialize and propagate bounding box values throughout
  plcolorbar
- Only calculate the bounding box contributions of colorbar caps once
- Make sure plvpor is called before each draw_* + calculate_limits call

This should bring plcolorbar back to a state where it renders properly for
basic and complex uses.

Use correct order for javac command line (with filename last) which
solves all the encoding issues.  Leave the encoding name as UTF-8
because that is what is recommended as the most general name for utf-8
encodings on the gcj man page.  However, experimentally gcj recognizes
the utf8 or utf-8 names as well so that name could be changed to
either of those if java tool chains that do not use gcj require it.

Change encoding option into a form recognized by gcj.

This works for my particular gcj tool chain, but if the strict
encoding option form demanded by gcj doesn't work for other tool
chains we will have to do some sort of tool-chain test to deal

Put the checks for XML::Parser and XML::DOM in a more central location
where they are guaranteed to happen (if perl is available).  This means
these perl modules can be used for, e.g., parsing swig documentation
regardless of whether octave and/or docbook have been enabled or not.
A further advantage of this new location for the checks
is these checks are not independently repeated
for the octave and docbook cases.

   M /trunk/drivers/wxwidgets.h

Calculate wxwidget macros in more logical order (inches first) such
that the resulting macros involving inches coordinates are exact integers.

Change the VSCALE macro from 32 to 40 so the maximum coordinate in the
call to plP_setphy is changed from 32*800 = 25600 to 40*800 = 32000.
This improves the wxwidgets resolution by a small but significant
amount without exceeding the maximum valid value for the plP_setphy
call which is 32767.

Add the constants that are defined via DATA statements to the list of exported symbols.
This is required by the MS VC/C++ - Intel Fortran combination, but not by gcc/gfortran.
Without these extra exports you get unresolved external symbols.

Note: the use of the hexadecimal numbers prevents us from using parameters. According to 
the Fortran 90/95 standards, you can not use such numbers for parameters. This has been
relaxed for Fortran 2003, so we may want to revisit this issue in the near future 
(both gfortran 4.6 and later and Intel Fortran 11.1 and later support such numbers in
the parameter statement.)

Use NON_TRANSITIVE linking by default for the shared libraries case for

I have assumed that is also the case on Mac OS X, and _not_ the
case on Windows systems, but those assumptions need testing.

the difference with the C example has disappeared)

Replace the iargc and getarg GNU extensions in
bindings/f95/configurable.f90 with the Fortran 2003 standard library
routines, command_argument_count and get_command_argument.

Arjen's tests show this change means it is no longer necessary to
build configurable.f90 in a separate static library on windows
platforms.  Therefore, remove all STATIC_OPTS logic from the build
system that made that separate static build possible. This means,
configurable.f90 is now completely equivalent to other source for the
plplotf95 library on all platforms now.  (Since it is not configured,
it is also time to change its name, but I will leave that to Arjen.)

This change has been tested with the test_diff_psc target on Linux
with good results (except for examples 20 and 28 because of on-going
blank issues and the missing example 00).  That target should also be tested
on Windows to make sure all is well with that platform for Fortran 95.

the multiplication sign for the default plfontld( 1 ) (i.e., the

We definitely don't want a type since this is Python syntax.
Furthermore, now that I have investigated a bit further, I think the
literal tags should surround the whole Python assignment statement. 
The result validates, but I haven't looked at the actual generated
documentation yet.  

As far as I know, this is our first attempt to deal in the redacted
form with the assignment statements that some languages (such as
Python, Perl, and Octave) use to handle C output arguments.  So this
needs further review as we gain experience with those languages for
the PLplot functions that have output arguments (plgriddata, plgdev,
plgfnam, plgdev for the arrays, and many more functions that output
single-variable arguments.)

For the --apply option change the shell script logic to do the
following steps:

1. List all files (and diffs all files if the --diff option is used as
well) that will be changed.

2. Ask whether you want to apply those changes.  If no, immediate exit.
If yes, proceed with the further steps.

3. Apply the changes.

4. List all files (and diffs all files if the --diff option is used as
well) that required further styling after the current style changes
were made.  Normally, this step does not list anything, but it does
warn you when further runs of the script are required on those rare
occasions where uncrustify has to be applied iteratively.

Large changes to functions taking 2-d arrays to convert from (const PLFLT **) to (const PLFLT * const *) . Use of const PLFLT ** is not really safe (generates gcc warnings) as it only ensure the data is unchanged, not the arrays of pointers. It is therefore trivial to change the array contents by changing the pointers. This is not generally what is intended.

Update build system so that the plf95demolib library works properly in
the build tree, the installed examples built and tested with our
CMake-based build system and the installed examples built and tested
with the traditional Makefile + pkg-config approach.

For now I have chosen the approach of installing the library and module in
the standard places, but it might be better to install those
in $prefix/share/plplot5.?.?/examples/f95 since they are designed to
be completely specific with regard to our Fortran 95 examples.

I have also chosen to link to the new plf95demolib library outside the
pkg-config system for our traditional build of the installed f95
examples by configuring the Makefile appropriately.

Remove CMake-2.6 logic from our build system(s) since the minimum

successfully tested with the four tests (test_noninteractive for the three

The remaining 17 tests (test_interactive for the three different trees
for the shared library case and all 7 tests for both the nondynamic
and static build cases) should be orthogonal to the above changes so
the four tests above should have adequate coverage of these changes.

The D case is no longer treated as a special case because

Provide NON_TRANSITIVE ON option only for the case of shared libraries.

For the internal static library case, transitive linking is used
regardless by CMake so the only effect of NON_TRANSITIVE ON for this
case would be non-transitive linking for pkg-config used by the
traditional build and test of the installed examples.  Such linking
can introduce inconsistencies with the linking and software library
detection of the core PLplot build.  So avoid that potential
inconsistency by simply not allowing NON_TRANSITIVE ON for the
static internal library build for PLplot.

Improve commentary concerning the NON_TRANSITIVE option.

Implement the FORCE_EXTERNAL_STATIC option for the (internal) static
library case (NOT BUILD_SHARED_LIBS) to force CMake to find and use
only external libraries with a *.a suffix (i.e., static libraries).
This suffix trick only works with UNIX so FORCE_EXTERNAL_STATIC is
ignored in all other cases. The option is experimental.  In fact, it
still does not completely work at this time because of pkg-config
complications. Therefore, its default value is OFF.

Implement NON_TRANSITIVE case for the wxwidgets and qt_gui bindings.  
This commit should complete my NON_TRANSITIVE work.

scripts/comprehensive_test.sh showed no errors with the

--cmake_added_options -DNON_TRANSITIVE=ON --do_shared yes
--do_nondynamic yes --do_static no

options.  The most recent Linux distributions such as Fedora
and Debian unstable have stricter linkers than my Debian stable
platform, and there is more work to do on those systems before
the above test will pass.

That leaves the "--do_static yes" case where I encountered some
pkg-config trouble in the traditional installed examples build because
the --static option for pkg-config has the side effect that only
static external libraries are looked for, and one of those was missing
on my system. This bad result was due to inconsistency between the
forced static libraries used by pkg-config when the --static option is
used and the shared libraries that CMake tends to look for and use.

That issue can be solved on Unix by configuring our CMake-based build
system to only look for and use static external libraries.  But
implementing that idea will take some substantial additional effort.

By default use -j8 parallel build option rather than -j4.  It doesn't
seem to slow anything down to have all those tasks contending for my
two processors (and I think that would also pertain to the single
processor case), and there may be an advantage because if some process
is waiting for i/o, others can use the cpu(s).  In any case, with -j8,
the "top" application shows %wa almost always at 0 per cent, i.e., the
cpu's are kept busy with no pauses waiting for i/o to finish.  That is
the ideal result.

Implement NON_TRANSITIVE case for the tclmatrixd and plplottcltkd

Build and run tests (using the test_diff_psc and test_interactive
targets in the build tree and the compare and test_interactive targets
in the traditional installed examples tree) produced results without
obvious errors on Debian stable.  However, the latest Linux
distributions such as Fedora or Debian unstable have a linker that
enforces linking rules much more stringently than Debian stable so
additional tests (and likely some fixes) are required before
-DNON_TRANSITIVE=ON will work correctly for the tclmatrixd and

Confirmed that the experimental plplotdmd_SHARED option (which builds the
libplplotdmdd library for the D bindings as shared) does not work
for Debian stable.  The reason is the linker includes a static D library
that is not built with the -fPIC flag so cannot be linked to a shared
version of libplplotdmdd.

Set the plplotdmd_SHARED option globally.

Configure the traditional Makefile for the installed examples to use
the pkg-config --static flag when appropriate (e.g., for the default
plplotdmd_SHARED OFF case).

In anticipation that plplotdmd_SHARED will work some day, implement
non-transitive linking of libplplotdmd.  However, this is a no-op for
the current default plplotdmd_SHARED OFF case where libplplotdmd is
built statically so the build-tree and traditional installed examples
tree D examples have many unused direct dependencies as a result.

These changes have been built and run-time tested for the build tree
and traditional installed examples tree.

The only way to test whether these changes suppress unnecessary
linking is (i) find a platform where -Dplplotdmd_SHARED=ON works, and
(ii) on that platform try -DNON_TRANSITIVE=ON for both the build
tree and the traditional installed examples tree.

Implement NON_TRANSITIVE case for the Ada bindings.  When obvious
false positives were discounted, ldd -u showed perfect results for the
Ada examples in both the build tree and "traditional" installed
examples tree (that was built and tested with make and pkg-config).

Build and run tests in the build tree and traditional installed
examples tree produced results without obvious errors on Debian
stable.  However, the latest Linux distributions such as Fedora or
Debian unstable have a linker that enforces linking rules much more
stringently than Debian stable so additional tests (and likely some
fixes) are required before -DNON_TRANSITIVE=ON will work for Ada
on those platforms.

Implement NON_TRANSITIVE case for the fortran bindings.  When obvious
false positives were discounted, ldd -u showed perfect results for the
Fortran examples in the build tree, but slightly imperfect results in
the traditional installed examples tree because we have failed to
configure a separate *.pc file for the plplotf77c and plplotf95c
libraries, and lumped that information instead into the *.pc files
associated with the plplotf77 and plotf95 libraries.  I will leave it
to someone else to fix that.

Build and run tests in the build tree and traditional installed
examples tree produced results without obvious errors on Debian
stable.  However, the latest Linux distributions such as Fedora or

Tweak wording concerning the announcement of the Windows
MinGW/gfortran compiler issue.  Most of these tweaks concern
qualifying all references to gfortran that appear in this announcement
with the "MinGW/" prefix. The point of this qualification is this
problem is limited to Windows.  Therefore, we don't want to concern
users of gfortran on Linux or Mac OS X by using the unqualified
gfortran term anywhere in this particular announcement.

Bump minimum version of CMake to 2.8.2 for Linux and 2.8.6 for
all other platforms as discussed on the plplot-devel mailing list.

I have just confirmed that CMake-2.8.6 gives good results on Linux
(using the ctest test), but that also needs to be tested on our other
platforms.  As soon as that platform testing is complete, I plan to
remove the CMake-2.6.x logic and files that are currently part of our
build system.

Completely reorganize the script.

Now exits immediately if there is a detected error condition rather
than using a bunch of Boolean logic with appropriate massive
indentation to implement the various exits.

Now more care is used with the order of the commands executed and what
is cleaned to reduce the high-water mark of disk usage as much as
possible.  These changes mean, e.g., the interactive tests will
require rebuilds of things that were cleaned previously, but that is a
relatively small sacrifice in cpu time to keep the high-water mark
(currently ~3-4GB) smaller than the alternative without these changes.

Be more discriminating in what is removed by the clean target for the
traditional build system.

*.txt ==> *_*.txt

The point of this change is to avoid removing the top-level
CMakeLists.txt file which was not a good thing!

Implement the list_example_files function to generate lists of files
created by plplot-test.sh.

Use that function to create complete OUTPUT files for the custom
commands used for non-interactive testing.  This change automatically
assures "make clean" will remove essentially all plot file output
generated by the test_noninteractive target.  This should greatly
reduce the disk space requirements of scripts/comprehensive_test.sh
when the (default) --do_clean_as_you_go option is used for that
script.

ToDo: implement a custom target to use this same function to
remove all ctest file output to reduce the disk requirements
of scripts/comprehensive_test.sh some more.
