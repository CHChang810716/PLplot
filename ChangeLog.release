noninteractive tests which can be run as a background job
with no interaction required from the user.

If cmake is epa_built as one of the buildtools on MinGW/MSYS
platforms, ignore it in favor of the more powerful Windows binary
version you can download from kitware.  This measure will be required
until the curl library and its dependencies (including openssl) are
configured as part of epa_build and made dependencies of the cmake
epa_build. Without access to an external curl, cmake drops back to its
internal curl library which does not allow downloads of "https" URLS
(essential for epa_build to work!).

Improve logic dealing with ENABLE_COMPREHENSIVE_PLPLOT_TEST choices.

This logic gives good test results (so far just the noninteractive
case has been tested) for the epa_build build_plplot_lite
target on Linux for -DENABLE_COMPREHENSIVE_PLPLOT_TEST=ON

A preliminary subset of those plplot_lite tests have been successfully
run on MinGW/MSYS/Wine, and a job with the same comprehensive test
conditions as above has been started on that platform.

Adjust to new version of Hǎiliàng Wáng's check programme which now has
a -incdir argument to specify where the configured headers included by
plplot.h are located.

This change in "check" means it is no longer necessary to copy plplot.h from
the source to the build directory in order to get this
application to work.

Tested on Linux using the check_api_xml_consistency target which
still produces a clean result on the consistency of api.xml with
our API as defined by plplot.h.

Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux using
the validate target and the check_api_xml_consistency target (which is
now available when the cmake option, ADD_SPECIAL_CONSISTENCY_CHECKING,
is set to ON).  This last test showed there is no more missing
documentation of our public API in api.xml.  However, that target also
shows there are still a lot of argument inconsistencies between
plplot.h and api.xml to sort out.

Implement ADD_SPECIAL_CONSISTENCY_CHECKING build system option that
adds some custom check targets that ordinarily are not added to
a normal build because of the extra dependencies.

One of these targets is the already existing
check_plplot_h.inc target (to check consistency
of the octave binding).

Also implement the check_api_xml_consistency target which is an
additional target of this kind.  That target uses Hǎiliàng Wang's
check application (written in Go and available from
https://github.com/hailiang/go-plplot/tree/master/c/check) to check
the consistency of api.xml with plplot.h.

Make api.xml more consistent with the plplot.h header.  These issues
were all discovered by a consistency checker written by Hǎiliàng Wang.

Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> using the
"make validate" command.

ToDo: The checker found ~10 functions in the public API of PLplot that
are undocumented in api.xml.  At least one of those (plwid) is
deprecated so some conditional programming using the PL_DEPRECATED
macro should be used to eliminate that function (and any other
officially deprecated function) from consideration by the consistency
checker.  Also, some of those ~10 functions will actually need to be
documented in api.xml to provide a clean checker report.

For the MinGW case, install the *.o files that are created by the
plplotada library build.  This installation is not required on Linux,
and even for the MinGW case gnatmake does not require these *.o files
to be installed in order to build the installed Ada examples, but when
those built examples are run, they immediately fail with a return code
of 3 unless these *.o files are installed. Therefore, I am pretty sure
this is a workaround for a MinGW gnatmake issue.

Define and use ENABLE_tkX and ENABLE_itkX to help distingush cases
where X is present or not along with Tk and Itk.

Define and use generic_interactive_device, the device that
is to be used with generic interactive tests.  Normally, this
device is xwin on Unix (with X) and wingcc on Windows (without X), but
for the test case where X has not been found on Unix, it is ntk.

Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux where
the find for X11 was temporarily commented out so nothing X related
was defined, and the build-system logic normally used for the Windows
case could be tested (but with ntk as the generic interactive device).

ldd -r and nm --undefined-only showed no issues for -dev ntk, the
plplottcltk library, and the pltcl executable.  The
test_pltcl_standard_examples and test_tclsh_standard_examples targets
completed without issues (after the ntk cmd array overflow bug found
by example 27 was fixed).  Note all these tests were in the build tree
for the shared library/dynamic devices case so additional more
comprehensive testing of these widespread changes with
scripts/comprehensive_test.sh is recommended in the long term.

Follow the directions in bindings/tcl/plitclgen to run that perl

gen.itcl results that are generated by plitclgen.

It has been many years since this was done before so the effect of all
this is a fairly large number of additions to the methods listed in
PLWin.itk (because the PLplot API has expanded) and the removal of a
few methods that are no longer a part of the PLplot API.

Update epa_build configuration so that itk (version 4.0.0) successfully builds on

N.B. A patch corresponding to running "autoreconf -i" on Linux has
been applied rather than just running "autoreconf -i" on all platforms
because autoreconf is broken on MSYS. Note, this patch is not really
necessary for itk because the resulting changes to the configure
script are so small they don't make a practical difference.  However,
I wanted to pioneer applying "autoreconf -i" this way since
configure.in for itk4 is not that different than for itk3, and the
equivalent patch for the itk3 case might make such a large change in
the itk3 configure script that it solves the internal error for that
script that is current stopping the itk3 epa_build.
