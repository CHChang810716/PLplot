    Update scripts/make_tarball.sh from svn to git
    
    In addition to modifying this script to work with git, I updated the
    messages generated by the script, and (most importantly) fixed a
    long-standing bug in the script where the exported working directory
    was used for "testing the tarball" as opposed to the correct unpacked
    source tree from the tarball.

    The release date is now set in doc/docbook/src/CMakeLists.txt since it
    only affects the documentation generation.  The actual value has been
    approximately updated to 4 days from now to reflect my current
    best guess concerning the release date, but that value will likely
    be updated again.
    
    All libraries that used to have the "d" suffix for their name have had
    their SOVERSIONS bumped to reflect that backward-incompatible change
    in the library name.

    Remove "c_" prefix from plsdevdata.
    
    The plsdevdata function is currently used only by the wxwidgets device driver and
    associated binding.  This function might be used for other device
    drivers later on whether written in c++ or c.  But this function is not
    part of the common API and should not be propagated to any binding other than
    c++.  Therefore remove the "c_" prefix which is an incorrect indicator that this
    function is part of the common API that should be propagated to all bindings.

    Build system: Fix long-standing -DUSINGDLL bug
    
    -DUSINGDLL should only be used as a compile flag for the shared
    library case.  This bug only affected the build of the qt_gui and
    smoke bindings on Windows for the static library case.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    by running cmake.  (A simple test that no syntax errors were
    introduced.)  An actual build of libplplotqt for the static library
    case on Windows is needed for definitive testing of this fix.

    Changes to enable OLD_WXWIDGETS to work with recent canges in plplot
    core.
    OLD_WXWIDGETS now ignores the cmap, fill chr and sym state changes if
    they occur before wxWidgets inititialization. This aviods a call to
    install_buffer, which leads to creatioon of a new wxStream which during
    initialization can generate the above state changes and generate an
    infinite loop.
    Also added a check for dev->resizing in plD_eop_wxwidgets. This is
    because replaying the buffer now generates eop events which would
    otherwise cause wxRunApp to be called renentering the message loop
    before the resize event had been dealt with.

    Traditional build system for installed examples: solve qt_example segfault for ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS=OFF
    
    Like the core build system, it turns out that for the traditional
    build system of the installed examples qt_example cannot be linked
    against both libplplotqt and libplplot when ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS=OFF.
    For unknown reasons that duplicate code in two libraries case causes a
    severe memory management issue (invalid reads and an eventual
    segfault) at plend.

commit fa0c8796e14b3888884aeeac90d2af06a7b68199
Author: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
Date:   Sat Mar 21 10:22:50 2015 -0700

    Build system: Solve qt_example segfault for ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS=NO case
    
    For the ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS=NO case the qt (and other) device driver
    code is stored in libplplot, but qt normally depends on the code
    in libplplotqt which in turn depends on libplplot.  So to break this
    circular linking chain, the libplplotqt code is also stored in libplplot
    with libplplot not linking to (or depending on) libplplotqt.  So
    the net result is we have identical code stored in both libplplot and
    libplplotqt, and if we manipulate visibility so that qt_example uses
    one or the other, all is well.
    
    However, previously, qt_example was linked to both plplot and plplotqt
    for the ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS=NO case which is redundant.  More seriously,
    and for reasons I don't understand this choice of linking to the same
    code in two different libraries caused severe memory management issues
    when the libraries were closed.  So the fix for this issue was simply
    to drop the redundant link to plplotqt for qt_example.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    for the shared libaries/static devices (ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS=NO) case
    in the build tree by building plplot, plplotqt, and qt_example, testing
    each of those with "ldd -r", and running examples/c++/qt_example
    under valgrind.

    Build system: Fix potential MSVC symbol visibility issues
    
    For this commit I reviewed all C and C++ add_executable commands, and
    if for the shared libraries case there was a link to a PLplot library,
    I made sure the source code property COMPILE_FLAGS included the
    -DUSINGDLL flag to ensure PLplot library symbols were properly imported into
    the executable for the MSVC case.  At the same time I took the
    opportunity to clean up some minor style issues I noticed such as
    white space and replacing SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES ==>
    set_source_files_properties.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux in the
    build tree for the default shared libraries case.  This extremely
    light testing was simply to run cmake and "make all" to make sure no
    obvious CMake syntax errors were introduced by these changes.
    Comprehensive Linux testing will follow, but the net effect on Linux
    of these changes is expected to be NULL, and it is only MSVC tests
    that will indicate if these changes actually solve the long-standing
    visibility issues on that platform for the shared libraries case.

    Build system: For shared libraries case always set USINGDLL macro for C examples
    
    This should make an important improvement for the MSVC case where
    from include/pldll.h.in, apparently USINGDLL has to be #defined for
    the import case, i.e., for building the C examples (as opposed to the
    export case when building libraries where USINGDLL has to be #defined
    for all compilers).
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    by building all in the build tree.  This is only a light test
    to make sure there are no errors in the CMake logic.  The real
    test comes later for the MSVC case, and if that is a success, then
    must follow up with similar changes for all examples for all compiled
    languages.

    wxwidgets: Implement OLD_WXWIDGETS option
    
    If the user sets OLD_WXWIDGETS=ON they effectively end up using the
    wxwidgets device, binding, and example from commit 924b06ccffee1f (the
    commit prior to the introduction of the new wxwidgets code).
    
    Note all the bindings/wxwidgets/deprecated*,
    drivers/deprecated_wxwidgets*, and
    examples/c++/deprecated_wxPLplotDemo.cpp "new" files have been taken
    from commit 924b06ccffee1f with #included file names changed to the
    deprecated versions when appropriate.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux using
    the CMake option -DLD_WXWIDGETS=ON, and by building the targets
    test_c_wxwidgets and wxPLplotDemo.  However, the target
    test_wxPLplotDemo (which runs wxPLplotDemo) has a major issue
    (run-time problems creating a stream) because stream support for
    drivers has been changed in PLplot in a backwards-incompatible way.
    Someone else will have to figure out how to adjust the old wxwidgets
    device, binding, and/or example for this change.

    When BUILD_DOC is ON this custom target builds all components of

    faster than the "all" target that has previously been used for this

    only builds the necessary subset of PLplot required to generate the

    epa_build: libharu: Add hpdf_namedict.h and hpdf_pdfa.h to the headers that are installed
    
    This change in the CMake-based build system for libharu follows what
    headers are installed in the autotools-based build system for libharu.
    For some reason the lack of these installed headers did not cause issues for
    my previous epa_builds, but they did cause issues for Andrew Ross's
    recent epa_build.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux using
    an epa_build of libharu and plplot.  The result was the above headers
    were install, and the test_noninteractive target worked fine in the
    latter case (as it had done before).  Subsequent viewing of the pdf
    results for each of the examples showed some long-standing (as far as
    I can recall) rendering issues for the pdf device driver which have
    now been documented at <https://sourceforge.net/p/plplot/bugs/155/>.

    epa_build: qt5_lite: Update Qt5 build configuration
    
    Since making a complete build of Qt5 did not make any difference
    to the invalid read memory management issue for qt_example and -dev
    qtwidget, change the build back to a minimal build that is even
    smaller than we tried before with Qt5.3.2.  This changes the
    epa_build time of Qt5 from 2 hours to 13.5 minutes, and does
    not compromise PLplot's use of Qt5.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux using
    an epa_build of PLplot (which necessarily triggers an epa_build of
    Qt5) and running tests on that PLplot version. Those tests included
    valgrind runs of example 1 for -dev svgqt, pdfqt, pngqt, and bmpqt
    (all with no memory management errors), valgrind runs with -dev
    qtwidgets (which showed the invalid read), and a build of the
    test_noninteractive target.

    Move declaration of plhrsh from individual source files to
    include/plplotP.h header as a matter of good style.  Deliberately do
    not make plhrsh externally visible with the PLDLLIMPEXP macro since
    this function should be hidden from external use from outside

    Style previous commits
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux. This
    testing was done not only to test this commit, but the very large
    series of wxwidgets/plbuf commits done recently.  I looked carefully
    at the rendering of most pages for all examples for -dev wxwidgets
    with the remaining issues reported to list (and eventually to
    the wxwidgets overall bug report).
    
    I also checked -dev tk for the zoom regression, and confirm that
    regression as well as a newly introduced regression for that device
    (two windows are displayed rather than one with one of them blank
    with the plframe decorations and the other showing an xwin-like plot
    windows with no decorations).
    This new regression (and likely the zoom regression) are showstoppers
    for the current release.
    
    I did no testing of the new plmeta/plrender, and I also did no testing
    to look for other regressions in rendering for non-wxwidgets devices.

    epa_build: qt5_lite; change Qt5 build configuration
    
    This is an effort to change the build configuration options to
    be as close to those used by the Debian testing packages as possible
    on my Debian stable platform without harfbuzz.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on
    Linux by epa_building qt5_lite and plplot and doing some
    run time tests with valagrind.
    
    Unfortunately, the result was the same as all previous configurations
    I have tried; the qt5 epa_build worked with no obvious configuration,
    build, or install issues. (Although it now takes two hours rather than
    20 minutes to complete the build of qt5_lite because of all the extra
    components that are built now.) Plplot also had no obvious build or
    install issues.  For example, ldd showed that drivers/qt.so was linked
    to the correct (Qt5) versions of the libraries that were just epa_built
    and installed (as expected).
    However, valgrind still showed a single invalid read error on exit
    from -dev qtwidget which is not confirmed by Andrew's equivalent
    valgrind tests on Ubuntu where drivers/qt.so is linked to the Ubuntu
    version of the Qt5 libraries.

    epa_build: Qt5: change version from 5.3.1 to 5.3.2.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux by
    epa_building qt5-lite.  The build succeeded without issues and also
    failed at run time the same as 5.3.1 (valgrind demonstrated memory management
    issues, i.e., invalid reads for all plend commands or when exiting
    from OK gui for cursor in qt_example.  Some of those issues resulted
    in a segfault, and none of these memory management issues occur for
    Qt4.) For 5.3.2 versus 5.3.1 there were no additional character offset
    issues (checked specifically with example 2 and
    examples/python/test_circle.py.) The build took more than
    twice as long (24 minutes versus 11 minutes) as the 5.3.1 build for
    the same configuration so undoubtedly there is some work to do to
    refine the configuration to get rid of unneeded components.
    
    I momentarily tried to build 5.4.1 (now commented out) with the
    identical configuration used for 5.3.1 and (so far) 5.3.2 builds, but
    the 5.4.1 build failed with a number of error messages starting with

    its own redraws.
    
    - Changed src/plmetafile.c to handle scaling from the metafile coordinate
    system to the device coordinate system.
    
    - Changed src/plmetafile.c, drivers/plmeta.c, and src/plbuf.c to correctly
    handle the PLESC_HAS_TEXT function.

    Used wxFONTENCODING_DEFAULT rather than its utf8 equivalent in wxPLDevice::SetFont. This removes
    the wxWidgets generated error message about being unable to find a utf8 encoded font on Windows,
    but still correctly renders the glyphs in example 24.

    Added some code to make debugging wxPLViewer easier.
    a #define WXPLVIEWER_DEBUG is included (but commented out) in wxwidgets_dev.cpp. Uncommenting this
    line means that the random characters are removed from the memory ap name and that the driver will
    not run wxPLViewer. Instead it will wait for the developer to run wxPLViewer thereself in the
    debugger.

    Fixed calls to plpat being missed from the buffer.
    
    To do this I moved the plP_state call from c_plpsty to spat, which is called from both c_plsty and
    c_plpat. Also both the pattern index and the pattern parameters (number of lines, inclination and
    separation) are stored in the buffer. On replot the pattern style is set directly in the stream,
    and the pattern parameters via a call to c_plpat, which ensures the driver is called as necessary.

    Fixed reentrant behaviour in wxPLViewer where wxPlFrame::OnCheckTimer initiated rendering which
    caused a yield and allowed OnCheckTimer to be called again before the previous call completed.

    colour correctly set.

    Hopefully fixed problem with wxPLViewer on Linux. It  seemed to be caused because the
    wxCreateWindowEvt is generated multiple times on linux causing multiple attemps to
    initialise the wxplstream in wxPLplotwindow.
    Also checked to ensure the buffer exists before attempting a replot from the wxWidgets driver.

    Changed the wxwidgets driver and binding to make use of the plsdevdata function. Now we can det
    the wxDC using this function before the device initialisation allowing us to know at this point
    whether we want to draw on a user supplied wxDC or the separate wxPLViewer.
    
    This was quite a major change and some other alterations were made at the same time.
    
    The default dpi is now only used if the user has not called plspage. It then becomes the users
    responsibility to set the dpi at the same time. If the user set the page size but not the dpi then
    the driver issues a warning.
    
    The wxPLplotwindow has had some major changes. We now require a dc available at all time for
    drawing to rather than just in the OnPaint method. We had to make the dcs pointer created with
    new. This was because changing the size of the bitmap being drawn to causes lots of problems (at
    least on Windows) with wxGCDC unless we have a fresh wxMemoryDC, and (because there is no
    wxGCDC::SetlectDC type method) this requires a new wxGCDC too.
    
    Added try cath blocks to all the dispatch table functions to avoid throwing an exception into the
    C  library.
    
    Removed  all the attempts to guess whethe the user wanted to use their own dc.
    
    made sure that during all drawing commands the pen and brush of the dc are reinstated to there
    previous styles
    
    changed from using wxThePenList to just creating pens as the former sometimes caused problems as
    there seemed to be no pens in the list, resulting in assert fails
    
    fixed bug where xdpi was used instead of ydpi in wxPLDevice::SetSize
    
    Allowed wxPLViewerClearBackground to draw on the dc as beginPage will now actually be called
    during a replot
    
    Fixed bug in wxPLDevice::SetWidth where alpha channel was missed.

    pkg-config: Convert Qt5::<component> imported library names to a form that pkg-config can understand
    
    The Qt5 cmake logic that is part of Qt development (as opposed to
    CMake development) uses the name convention that Qt5::<Module> is the
    name of the imported library target name for each Module.  This change
    translates those target names to file locations that pkg-config can
    understand.  Part of this change is to translate those target names to
    disk locations which typically include a trailing version number, e.g.,
    <some prefix>/libQt5Core.so.5.3.1.  So the current change also required
    modifying the suffix_pattern used in the pkg_config_link_flags
    function for the .so case from \\.so to \\.so.* to allow trimming off
    that extra version information when reducing absolute disk locations to
    the standard pkg-config form such as
    
    -L<some prefix> -lQt5Core
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux for an
    epa_built Qt5 and Plplot case.  The comprehensive test for that case
    was a success for the shared library/dynamic device configuration.
    (Before this fix that comprehensive test configuration had failed for
    the sub-case of the traditionally built installed examples tree
    because pkg-config (obviously) cannot understand the untransformed raw
    Qt5::<Module> CMake syntax.

    wxwidgets device driver: Replaced undocumented wxFont method with documented variant
    
    The official wxwidgets documentation does not document the wxFont
    overloaded variant that we were using which was likely taken from a
    much earlier version of wxwidgets (but still supported with
    wxwidgets-2.8.12 for backwards compatibility).  So to follow best
    practice and also to follow what is done with the font sample
    (demonstration code showing how to display wxwidgets accessible fonts
    in a GUI), I changed to using a documented variant of wxFont to set up
    the font.  The hope was this change would sort out the missing glyph
    issue, since the font sample GUI displays all the utf-8 Peace words
    without issues.
    
    However, the wxwidgets device results for all unicode examples are
    exactly the same as before (two missing glyphs from example 23 and
    numerous missing glyphs frome example 24).  So the missing glyph
    issue for wxwidgets is likely due to something else then the
    font setup.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux by
    building the wxwidget device (and all the C examples) in the build
    tree then running the unicode (18th, 23rd, 24th, and 26th) examples by
    hand with -dev wxwidgets and looking for missing glyphs in the
    results.
    
    This change was suggested by the font sample

    "definitive fix" version 2 for the rt linking issues
    
    I must have made a grep mistake with my nm analysis before because it
    turns out that both the wxwidgets device driver and wxPLViewer source
    code includes drivers wxwidgets_comms.cpp which contains the key calls
    to shm_open and shm_unlink, and the corrected nm analysis supports
    that conclusion.
    
    For some reason Ubuntu worked with the previous explicit linking of
    wxPLViewer with librt but no explicit linking of the wxwidgets dll
    with that library.  This may be due to differences between dynamic
    loading of the wxwidgets dll and run-time loading of the wxPLViewer
    application. But best practice requires that dll and utility both to
    be explicitly linked to the rt library for all Unices other than Mac
    OS X so that is what is done for this commit (with the necessary move
    of the required determination of the CMake RT_LIB variable from
    utils/CMakelists.txt to the cmake/modules/wxwidgets.cmake location
    which makes RT_LIB universally accessible to all CMake code).
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    using the test_c_wxwidgets in the build tree.  Also, before the
    fix the nm analysis gave this result
    
    software@raven> nm -a --demangle utils/wxPLViewer |grep shm_
                     U shm_open@@GLIBC_2.2.5
                     U shm_unlink@@GLIBC_2.2.5
    software@raven> nm -a --demangle drivers/wxwidgets.so |grep shm_
                     U shm_open
                     U shm_unlink
    
    i.e., nm referred to undefined unversioned symbols for wxwidgets.  But
    after the fix these undefined symbols became versioned just like the
    symbols for wxPLViewer which I assume is an indicator that the
    undefined symbols are resolved by the particular
    
    -- RT_LIB = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librt.so
    
    that is found on my system and which is used to explicitly link
    both wxPLViewer and wxwidgets now.

    wxPLViewer: drop explicit link to the rt library

    support the rt library even though that is a POSIX standard)
    and is not required on Debian stable.  Testing of additional

    Added plflush capability to the wxWidgets driver and changed the
    wxPLDevice::ClearBackground function so that it draws a rectangle
    using plplot functions. The latter change was required because
    when replotting from a buffer we have no concept of subpages and
    the subpage size is not stored in the buffer meaning we have no way
    to know how big an area to erase.
    
    Also added calling plP_bop() to rdbuf_bop. This is required to do
    the initial page setup. Previously in the wxWidgets driver this was
    performed by a manual call to wxPLDevice::BeginPage() from within
    wxPLDevice::SetSize() before calling plreplot(). The previous
    solution invalidated the principle of least surprise, but then also
    meant that the initial ClearScreen call appended drawing the above
    rectangle to the end of the buffer and plreplot then ended by erasing
    everything.
    
    This makes the Strip chart demo x17 work for wxWidgets now,
    although it is rather slow due to inefficient buffer copies.

    setting a stream number that is defined in the plplot library rather
    than plplotcxx library.  I don't understand this direct dependence,
    but nm confirms this as follows:
    
    nm --undefined-only --demangle bindings/wxwidgets/libplplotwxwidgets.so |grep plsstrm
                     U c_plsstrm
    
    So target_link_library necessarily must
    mention plplot in order for linking to work properly on all platforms.
    
    This investigation and fix was motivated by a report from Jim Dishaw
    that indicated the the linking of libplplotwxwidgets was failing
    on Mac OS X with a reference to _c_plsstrm (which presumably is the
    Mac OS X linker way to mangle c_plsstrm).

    Build systems: Fix configured test_tcl.sh for build tree and installed examples tree
    
    * Fix value of PLTCL_DIR_ESCAPED used to configure installed version
    of test_tcl.sh.  This fixed a bug in the test_noninteractive results
    for the traditional version of the installed examples tree where
    core build-tree results were referenced rather than the expected
    install-tree results.
    
    * For build-tree and install-tree versions of test_tcl.sh remove many
    references to $tcldir/ since that can be a relative path location that
    fails when the script has already changed directory to $tcldir.  (This
    issue discovered when running plplot-test.sh on its own in the
    traditionally built version of the installed examples tree.)
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux

    libplplot bugfix: logical AND ==> bitwise AND
    
    Jim Dishaw's Apple compiler turned up some warnings concerning some
    long-standing incorrect use of the logical AND ("&&") operator in our
    core library code where the bitwise AND ("&") operator should clearly
    have been used instead.  This bug fix occurred for two places in the
    code:
    
    opt && MAG_COLOR ==> opt & MAG_COLOR
    
    and
    
    plsc->difilt && PLDI_ORI ==> plsc->difilt & PLDI_ORI
    
    However, every test I could throw at the unfixed
    and fixed results showed no differences in the results.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux using
    the test_diff_psc target in the build tree. The results of the test
    were good, and I also could not spot any discernible changes in the
    examples where MAG_COLOR was used. I also checked whether the
    long-standing parallelogram bug had been fixed by the above change,
    but
    
    examples/c/x01c -dev xwin -ori 0.2
    
    still turns the square plot box into a parallelogram, and a similar
    plot using xcairo shows an inconsistency between the (correct)
    orientation of the axis labels and the incorrect orientation/shape
    of the box.

    Remove use of m_plstate_width and m_plstatecolor variables in the
    wxWidgets driver. These tracked whether the width or color changed
    before initialization of the wxDC, however, we also need these variables
    to be reset after a page change and potentially a new wxDC set, so now
    always grab the current color and line width at the beginning of a new
    page. This fixes the rendering problems in x019

    Save device interface information to the buffer, this allows redraws
    performed by the buffer to correctly utilise orientation changes or
    other transforms set via the pldi_ini(0 function and functions that call
    this function.
    
    Modified the wxWidgets driver to correctly take advantage of these
    changes which required setting the PLStream aspect function and some
    rewriting of the sizing code which allows fixed aspect rendering.
    
    Modified the wxPLplotwindow class to fully clear the background on a
    redraw so that this reqirement is removed from the driver allowing it to
    just clear the subpages.

    Also changed the name of the library in accordance with the name that is actually used in the link step. Quite possibly the first line needs to be removed altogether. This requires some testing though.
    
    Note: I (Arjen Markus) could not test it because the current version of gfortran
    under MinGW does not seem to need such a file. The additional routines were taken from the corresponding definitions file for Intel Fortran on Windows.

    libplplot: fix issues with long-standing plSetOpt deprecation
    
    plSetOpt has been deprecated a long time, but the original
    implementation of that deprecation had some issues which are
    now fixed.  Those issues were the following:
    
    * Internal use of plSetOpt. This has now been completely fixed;
    plsetopt has replaced plSetOpt in a previous plrender fix, and for
    this commit, an unused plSetOpt declaration was removed in the D
    binding.
    
    * src/plargs.c declared plSetOpt for the case where
    -DPL_DEPRECATED=OFF to compensate for the lack of declaration
    in include/plplot.h for that case, but now that there is no
    internal use of plSetOpt, there is no need for that workaround
    and instead plSetOpt is now only declared
    and defined when -DPL_DEPRECATED=ON.

    so use the recommended plsetopt instead.

    Fixes to reading plot metafiles
    
    The original plan to utilize the plot buffer did not work because the
    coordinate system used in the plot metafile is not compatible with
    the device level coordinate system that is in the plot buffer.
    
    In order to keep redraws (one of the key uses of the plot buffer) fast,
    the same strategy used by plrender was adopted.  The metafile coordinate
    system is used to setup a coordinate system via plvpor() and plwind().
    
    This will need to be revisited for the next revision to the plot buffers
    that will support switching of devices to handle saving/printing.

    Style fixup
    
    This style update was generated by the
    
    scripts/style.sh --apply
    
    command (which in turn runs a python script
    to put comments in c99 "//" form and uncrustify
    to deal with all other style issues).
    
    This time, it was a large and intrusive change because I had
    waited for too long to run the script, and also because so
    much plbuf and wxwidgets work has landed on master recently.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    by running the test_noninteractive target in the build tree as
    well as running several standard examples with the wxwidgets and xwin
    devices and resizing those results.  I also looked at the results
    from
    
    git diff --ignore-all-space |less
    
    which didn't show any obvious problems in the restyling but did
    graphically illustrate (because of the change of comments to "//"
    style) that large parts of drivers/wxwidgets.cpp and
    examples/c++/wxPLplotDemo.cpp had been commented out.

    libplplot: Fix buildability (visibility) issue with plreadmetafile
    
    I fixed this visibility issue by declaring this function in plplotP.h with
    the appropriate PLDLLIMPEXP macro.  If we want more visibility for
    this function, the declaration should be moved to include/plplot.h, but
    we start with this declaration so that nobody experiences build issues
    for the shared library case on Linux (with
    -fvisibility=hidden gcc option) and presumably on Windows.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    by building the test_plbuf target using -fvisibility=hidden.

    Reworked the wxWidgets driver to allow two way communication with wxPLViewer. This permits multiple pages to be transmitted to one instance with wrapping round of the shared memory if needed. It will also permit calls to plgetcursor to work, althought his has not yet been implemented. This commit probably breaks the Linux version as it requires named mutexes to protect the shared memory and I haven't implemented the linux version of this yet. Note that to do this I had to add an escape for use in pl_cmd to import a buffer. This has been done in plbuf.c. In the future this may be altered in some way to make it more like the file import of the buffer, however that work is still in progress.

    Added support for using nopause for the wxWidgets driver. This include some changes to PLMemoryMap, so that there is an option to ensure the map name doesn't already exist, having multiple output memory maps stored at unique_ptrs in a std::vector and introducing a ? wildcard to the output memory map filename which will be replaced with random characters from A-Z. This should all mean that a particular peice of software can run multiple instances of wxPLViewer without their memory maps clashing.

    Moved SetBackgroundStyle call from wxPLplotwindow constructor to the OnPaint method. This avoids a segfault which I hit on a CentOS machine running wxWidgets 2.8.12 (but not on an Ubuntu machine running 3.0 nor a Windows machine running 3.0). Moving the call here ensures that Create has been called on the window which I guess was the likely problem. This call does nothing if the new style is the same as the old style so it shouldn't be a problem that it is called on every paint event.

    Reset the scaling in the wxWidgets driver. It now uses wxDC::SetLogicalScale so that the wxDC does conversion from plplot internal coordinates to native device coordinates. This gives us subpixel accuracy when using the wxGCDC interface. The exception is when drawin text. Here the driver does the scaling. Ths ib partly to avoid rewriting the rather complex code that deals with newines, sub/superscripts and rotation, but also because we should get better text hinting for on screen/raster graphics if we work in native coordinates (although I haven't checked if is really any different).

    wxWidgets driver rebuild part 1. The driver has benn totally rebuilt so that it only has a wxDC backend passed in by the user. Alternatively it has an option on the command line to write the buffer to a memory mapped file (functions on Windows only at the moment. This memory mapped file will be read by a seperate application, which will use the wxWidget driver but will create its own DC to write to. The wxApp code has all been commented out and will be copied into the new application. The wxPLDevBase and wxPLDev_DC classes have been merged into a wxPLDevice class. The free functions in wxWidgets.cpp have been tidied up and most of their functionality has been moved int the new class. There has been a lot of tidying up and removal of uneeded code. This should give us a much more streamlined and easily maintainable driver.

    Added ability to change the device context used by wxPLplotstream and removed the saving of the pointer to the dc as it is not used anywhere within the stream (it is still saved in the device).

    Removed the wxPLDevGC class and intstead set up wxPLDevDC to use a wxGCDC when a wxGraphicsContext is requested. Also did a little bit of cleanup related to the removal of the AGG backend and FreeType support in wxWidgets. This included removing the Update method from wxPLplotStream which only actually did anything when using the AGG backend. Also removed the wxwidgets_gc.cpp and wxplplotwindow.cpp files from the cmake build system as they have been deleted and tidied up wxwidget related mentions of AGG and freetype.

    Removed AGG backend - not that trying to use this backend will result in a plabort call, not defaulting to a wxDC, this is because from a wxWidgets app the AGG backend requires a wxImage* to be passed in and the othe backends require a wxBitmap*.

Date:   Sun Jan 11 21:39:52 2015 +0000

    Added function to use a wxGCDC in the wxPLplotwindow. Renamed the wxMemoryDC so it is a bit more consistent. Tidied up a few comments in wxPLplotwindow.cpp. The constructor for wxPLplotwindow now has a bool to set whether to use wxGCDC or not. It no longer has an int to set the backend. This means it can no longer use the AGG backend or the graphics context backend. The graphics context backend will be accessed via the wxGCDC and the AGG backend will be removed soon.

Author: Phil Rosenberg <philip_rosenberg@yahoo.com>
Date:   Fri Jan 9 14:35:50 2015 +0000

    Changed wxPLplotWindow to a templated class, where the type of wxWidget that you wish to inherit from is passed as the template parameter. This is preferred over the previous method (where wxPLplotWindow inherited from wxWindow) because it no longer requires multiple inheritance. E.g. previously to get a wxPLplotFrame you would inherit from wxPLplotWindow and wxFrame, both of which inherited from wxWindow, (i.e. the diamond problem) which makes working with such objects difficult and tedious. I also removed the event table and replaced it with bind calls. Now to create a wxPLplotWindow we use 2-stage initialisation: wxPLplotWindow<wxSomeWindowType> *myWindow=new wxPLplotWindow<wxSomeWindowType>; myWindow->Create(parent, id, ... ); Easy peasy!

commit 23011191ea005a921c25ae6fc394eee807ee1bd8
Author: jdishaw <jim@dishaw.org>
Date:   Wed Jan 28 21:40:54 2015 -0500

    Added obsolete commands to plbuf_control to attempt some backwards compatabilty with old plot metafiles.
    
    Removed unneeded malloc() and memcpy for LINE, POLYINE, and FILL when
    remaking the plot.  Temporary storage was used because of the old
    file-based buffer approach.  With the removal of file-based buffer
    code, a different apporach that uses pointers into the plot buffer could
    be used.
    
    Fixed the bug that caused random segfaults.  This could be manifested
    in several ways, one of them being a POLYLINE with over a billion nodes.
    The root cause was a mismatch in the data sizes between the buffer writer
    and the buffer reader (a wrong sizeof() was used).  Changed the code
    to use sizeof(variable) instead of sizeof(data type).
    
    Changed the buffer writer to maintain two-byte alignment.  This should
    avoid the performance penalty associated with misaligned arrays.

    Removed the deprecated temporary file buffer used in plbuf. The temporary file buffer was superseded in 2006 when the memory buffer approach was implemented. The temporary file buffer was disabled with #ifdef BUFFERED_FILE blocks in case it was needed. The capability for temporary file buffers was not documented and no one has asked for it. The decision was made to eliminate the code in order to reduce clutter and to simplify the revamping of plot metafiles.

    Python and Octave bindings: update documentation
    
    I used the check_swig_documentation to propagate the recent
    doc/docbook/src/api.xml changes to a comparison file for
    bindings/swig-support/swig_documentation.i.  After doing that
    comparison to make sure the new version was an improvement, I copied
    that comparison file
    (bindings/swig-support/swig_documentation.i_compare in the build tree)
    to bindings/swig-support/swig_documentation.i in the source tree.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux

    checked those documentation results on Python or Octave, but
    the file change does look good (see above) so I committed the change.

    Lua examples: math.log10(x) --> math.log(x,10)
    
    The pristine (upstream) version of Lua 5.2 dropped math10.log(x) and
    instead introduced an optional base argument to math.log so you can
    replace all calls to math10.log(x) by math.log(x,10). Some modern
    Linux distros (e.g. Debian) have kept legacy support for math10.log(x)
    to ease the transition to math.log(x,10), but that apparently has not
    occurred for Fedora.  Therefore, to simplify PLplot support on Fedora
    and future-proof the Lua examples for other distros, change our Lua
    examples to exclusively use the math.log(x, 10) alternative.
    
    Of course, this change means that Lua 5.2 is the minimum version of
    Lua we support, but that should be an acceptable constraint since
    Debian stable (likely the modern Linux distro with the oldest versions
    of all packages) already packages Lua 5.2.1.  Of course, that means
    PLplot enterprise class distros such as RHE, CentOS, etc. will have to
    either use old versions of PLplot or else build their own modern
    version of Lua.  But that is already a very common compromise forced
    on PLplot users for enterprise class distros so the Lua addition to
    that enterprise class burden is relatively small.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian stable with Lua-5.2.1) using the test_diff_psc target

    Build system.  Revert recent change to the Tk configuration
    
    It turns out that recent change (to use "package provide" rather than
    "package require" for one CMake test to find the Tk version in
    tcl-related.cmake) never works on Linux.  So that change was a
    roundabout way to insure that Tk was always disabled which is not the
    desired result.
    
    I have done extensive command-line tests, and "package provide" only
    appears to work with Tcl (presumably because tclsh loaded Tcl before
    that package command was executed), but not Itcl, Tk, Itk, or Iwidgets
    under either tclsh or wish.  So the conclusion is we must always stick
    with "package require" in tcl-related.cmake and accept that a working
    X will be required to configure Tk, Itk, or Iwidgets.  The logic in
    tcl-related.cmake does look for the case where either wish or tclsh
    error out.  However, if X is hanging rather than erroring out, (the
    issue which was "solved" by the commit that this commit reverts), I
    don't know a test for that issue that would not also hang.  Instead,
    it appears to me the only recourse for a user if X hangs is to specify
    -DENABLE_tk=OFF (which automatically turns off searching for or using
    Itk and Iwidgets as well).

    Build System: Fix bug for case where no display
    
    AWI for Arjen Markus.
    
    The issue was one of the Tcl commands used by our build system to
    find Tcl packages.  The Tcl command "package require" does not work if
    there is no display so replace it with "package provide" which
    does work for this situation and also the case when there is a display.

    Adjust for internal CMake-3.1 pkg-config change.
    
    There is a report from Greg Jung <gvjung@gmail.com> that the
    internal CMake command
    
    _pkg_check_modules_internal(0 0 ${_prefix} "${_package}")
    
    must be changed to
    
    _pkg_check_modules_internal(0 0 0 0 ${_prefix} "${_package}")
    
    for CMake-3.1 in order to build the cairo device properly.  Accordingly, I have made that adjustment.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users> on Linux using CMake-3.0.2
    by building the cairo device.
    
    N.B. currently untested for CMake-3.1.
    
    ToDo:
    
    Extensive tests on CMake-3.1 (once that version is closer to release)
    still need to be done since the change in the pkg-config support by
    CMake may need other adjustments as well.

    Move from uncrustify 0.58 to uncrustify 0.60 for styling our source
    code.
    
    This commit includes the following changes.
    
    1. Update annotated configuration file using
    uncrustify --update-config-with-doc -c uncrustify.cfg > uncrustify-0.60.cfg
    mv uncrustify-0.60.cfg uncrustify.cfg
    
    2. Update scripts/style_source.sh to change from 0.58 to 0.60 for the
    allowed uncrustify version.
    
    3. Run that script to update the style of a number of our source code
    files according to the uncrustify 0.60 rules.  We ascribe these large number
    of whitespace changes to changes in the implementation (new features
    with default configuration, bug fixes, and/or introduced bugs) between
    uncrustify 0.58 and 0.60.  Note that visual sampling of these changes didn't
    reveal any obvious style issues, and these changes also passed the test
    below:

    Changed variable names for map functions in the source - I will change
    them in documentation asap. These changes represent the fact that now we
    can use shapefiles the use of the variables has changed slightly. type
    has become name as it may also be a shapefile file name, minlong,
    maxlong, minlat and maxlat have become minx, maxx, miny and maxy as
    shapefiles may contain data that is projected - e.g. in km/miles/m etc.
    Note that the plmeridians function is untouched as this function is
    specifically for plotting lines of lat/long. The documentation must
    reflect that if plotting data not in lat/long coordinates, then calls to
    plmeridians must include a transform from lat/long

    Logic cleanup for recent commit concerning building the documentation.
    
    I agree with Phil's idea (no platform limits on documentation builds)
    motivating the last commit, but the implementation needed a small
    cleanup, i.e., I dropped redundant parentheses in the if statement and
    made then endif statement be consistent with the if statement to quiet
    CMake warnings about that inconsistency.

    Removed check for linux or cygwin in docbook.cmake because he cygwin check
    does not seem to work and it isn't really needed because only devs ever
    build the documentation and a build error if anyone tries on Windows or
    Mac is probably better than a silent fail in this case. Also removed the
    double build instruction from the README after testing Alan's fix for
    this.

    Use generator expression to find location of library used to get
    symbols for documentation needs.
    
    Previously this location was specified as src/libplplot.so in the build
    tree which worked fine on Linux, but a generator expression is a more general cross-platform
    way to specify locations, and may solve the "double build" workaround currently
    necessary to build documentation on Cygwin.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux using
    the CMake option -DBUILD_DOCon and the "pdf_target" target (which
    builds the pdf form of our documentation).

    Configure the installed PLplot header location in plplotqt.pro
    
    According to
    <http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qmake-project-files.html> qmake
    project files such as plplotqt.pro are a similar concept to pkg-config
    files; they summarize everything relevant to building a project in a
    nice compact format (in this case for qmake rather than pkg-config).
    
    According to
    <http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qmake-variable-reference.html#includepath>
    INCLUDEPATH is an important variable that is required to find the
    appropriate headers.  So simply removing this variable is not a good
    option since it will screw up any qmake user that is using anything
    but the "/usr" install prefix for PLplot.  So I have instead made
    plplotqt.pro configurable with INCLUDEPATH specified in the same
    configurable way as is done in pkgcfg/plplot-template.pc.in when
    configuring the header location for the pkg-config case.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    by running cmake and looking at the configured
    bindings/qt_gui/smoke/plplotqt.pro file in the build tree;
    the configured header location is correct in that file.
    
    ToDo: Figure out where the configured plplotqt.pro file
    should be installed, and then use the appropriate CMake command
    to install it there.

    Document additional software we need for the Documentation build.
    
    I updated the list of applications that are required

    I carefully went through cmake/modules/plplot.cmake and
    cmake/modules/docbook.cmake to find everything required
    so I am pretty sure this list is now complete.
    
    I also moved the "Cygwin Specific" section to a more logical location
    and wrote a similar "Linux Specific" section that lists exactly what
    packages need to be installed to build the documentation on Debian and
    gives what I hope is useful advice for building the documentation on
    rpm-based Linux distributions.

    Work around an egregious bug in smokegen parsing of -I options.
    
    It turns out that that the current version of smokegen on Debian stable
    (4:4.8.4-1) silently drops all -I options that have no space between
    the "-I" and the directory name.  I worked around this bug by
    inserting a space after each -I option to smokgen.
    
    I consider this an egregious smokegen bug because smokegen is trying
    to mimic how -I options are processed by compilers, but those
    compilers only honor -I options without spaces between the "-I" and
    the directory name.  (Or at least that is the only version of the -I
    option that is documented, in, e.g., the gcc info files.) Until
    smokegen follows how compilers parse -I option it violates the "least
    surprise" principle likely causing many smokegen users to trip over
    this issue like I just did.

    Fix file dependency issue for the docbook_plplot-symbols_txt
    custom_target.
    
    From Phil's recent evidence it appears that a
    docbook_plplot-symbols_txt target dependency is not enough to assure
    the plplot is always built before it is needed by the custom command
    associated with the docbook_plplot-symbols_txt target, and you need a
    file dependency as well.
    
    Follow the method suggested by the CMake documentation of specifying
    the plplot target in the DEPENDS of the associated custom command to
    automatically take care of both file and target dependencies on the
    plplot target.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux using
    the docbook_plplot-symbols_txt target after a "make clean".  As
    expected from the CMake documentation, the plplot target was run
    before the docbook_plplot-symbols_txt target was run.  Furthermore, a
    second run of the docbook_plplot-symbols_txt target produced no
    further changes (again as expected from the CMake documentation).

    f95: Remove all reference to plint in the examples.
    
    This change was done by sed script.  This returns our Fortran examples to
    close to what they were just prior to commit e1aaa2a2b as shown by
    
    git diff e1aaa2a2b^ -- examples/f95
    
    The point of this reversion of our plint changes in the examples is to
    follow our new Fortran philosophy (first formulated by Arjen) which is
    our Fortran interface should take the burden of all type changes
    rather than our users.  The result is a much less cluttered set of f95
    examples.
    
    To do:
    
    Arjen plans to do all the relevant integer kind and real kind
    manipulations in bindings/f95 so that our users can use the default
    integer type for integers and either single or double precision for
    real arguments, and those types will automatically be converted to the
    correct (private) kind=plint, kind=plunicode, and kind=plflt types in
    argument lists so that the resulting calls to the PLplot API best
    match the C type for integer and floating-point arguments that our
    core C code uses.
    
    Meanwhile, the present arrangement works only because our users are
    currently forced to use a Fortran real precision with PLplot that
    matches whatever was used for PLFLT, and the default integer type for
    Fortran currently matches the PLINT and PLUNICODE types used
    internally by PLplot.

    ps and psttf device drivers: fix reinitialization of current point location.
    
    The current change fixes a two-decade old fix in the ps device driver
    for the M (moveto) command after the C
    (setrgbcolor) command which prior to that old fix depended on
    coordinates which were sometimes undefined.  However, that old fix was
    implemented in a way that affected every change in state, not just the
    particular state calls for PLSTATE_COLOR0 and PLSTATE_COLOR1 that
    emitted C commands, see
    <http://sourceforge.net/p/plplot/plplot/ci/07eab71b70249ac03a0f89db4061583d968f7365>
    
    I have now changed the fix so that it only occurs for the relevant
    PLSTATE_COLOR0 and PLSTATE_COLOR1 cases.  The result is that the ps
    device driver is now much less sensitive to rounding issues, which do
    cause additional state changes which now do nothing but which before
    this fix triggered bare M commands.  For example, the results for the
    (as yet uncommitted) changes for Python and C example 8 disagreed
    before this fix with Python emitting two extra M commands, but those
    Python and C example 8 results now agree as a result of this fix.
    
    The old fix was propagated to the psttf device driver code so
    I fixed that as well.  Before the current fix, Python and C
    results for the psttfc device differed for example 8 with the
    Python version emitting two extra M commands, but now the
    psttfc results for those two languages agree.

    3D rendering: Greatly improve rendering of surface contours.
    
    A long-standing PLplot core C library issue has been that adjacent
    triangles that are filled for plot3dl often slightly overlap surface
    contours of the adjacent triangle leaving those surface contours
    looking like an ugly broken line.  The triangle filling is organized
    by quads with four triangles per quad.  I substantially reduced this
    surface contour issue by waiting until after the 4 triangles
    representing the quad had been rendered before rendering the surface
    contour.  That still leaves the possibility of adjacent quads breaking
    up the surface contours, but it appears that slight misalignment of
    quads is much less of a problem than misalignment of triangles within
    each quad so the resulting surface contours with this fix are much
    more continous than previously.
    
    I can also eliminate this surface contour issue entirely by waiting
    until after all the 3D quads have been rendered before rendering the
    surface contours, but that solution introduces a new issue; the quads
    do not hide the contours when they should. So the present fix appears
    to be the best compromise.

    C++: bug fix for fill3 and gradient for the multistream case.
    
    Previously, fill3 and gradient were incorrectly declared and defined
    following what was done for the fill special case.  The static
    attribute was used for the declaration and the set_stream call was
    commented out inside their definitions.  This will potentially lead to
    trouble for direct use of fill3 and gradient for the multistream case
    so I have removed the static attribute and called set_stream for these
    functions to make them conform to virtually all other C++ API.
    
    Note that fill3 and gradient are never used as callbacks which is why
    the above fix can be made without breaking API.  A similar fix is
    needed for the fill case, but the complication there is fill is used
    both directly (where static attribute should not be used and
    set_stream should be called) and also as a callback where the static
    attribute and no set_stream call should be used. so C++ API breakage will
    be required to distinguish those two cases.

    C, C++: update example 8.
    
    The changes are as follows:
    
    The sombrero function is now the default with the log_e of the
    Rosenbrock function the option.
    
    The index ranges for pages 5 and 10 are now elliptical and symmetrical
    around the centre of the sombrero.
    
    The semimajor and semiminor axes of the ellipse and the altitude and
    azimuth of the viewing angle have been adjusted to give nice-looking
    plots for pages 5 and 10.
    
    These changes should be finalized now so that either the C or C++
    version can be used as a template for propagation to other
    languages.

    Update the MinGW and MinGW/MSYS setup template to use CMake-3.0.2
    
    This template configuration is used "as is" by me for all my "MSYS
    Makefiles" tests and "MinGW Makefiles" tests.  (See
    cmake/epa_build/README for how to tailor this template configuration
    so you can run epa_build for either the "MSYS Makefiles" "MinGW
    Makefiles" cases.)
    
    The configuration is set up so that the downloaded (from Kitware and
    not Cygwin) binary version of CMake-3.0.2 is used rather than the
    previously used Kitware CMake-2.8.12.1.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on
    MinGW-4.7.2/MSYS/Wine-1.6.1 using an epa_build of plplot_lite
    (but with -DCOMPREHENSIVE_PLPLOT_TEST_INTERACTIVE=OFF
    -DCOMPREHENSIVE_PLPLOT_TEST_NONINTERACTIVE=OFF to speed completion
    of the build and install by avoiding all run-time tests).  The run-time
    version of PLplot that was epa_built in the epa_build/Build/build_plplot
    build tree
    was (extremely) lightly tested by changing directory to that directory,
    putting the dll subdirectory first
    on the PATH and running
    
    bash.exe-3.1$ examples/c/x01c.exe -dev psc -o /z/tmp/test.psc
    
    That result was identical (except for the embedded date/time) with
    the corresponding Linux result, i.e, this light run-time test
    gave perfect results with CMake-3.0.2 just like comprehensive testing
    of PLplot for the MinGW-4.7.2/MSYS/Wine-1.6.1 platform and
    CMake-2.8.12.1 gave perfect results in March.

    doc: License man files under the FreeBSD documentation license
    
    This license is identical to the one used for our DocBook src files.
    Rafael Laboissiere has recently agreed to this explicit licensing for
    the man files (which he wrote a decade ago).
    
    Note the licensing text is embedded in comments within the man page
    files.  I believe that should be sufficient, and I have therefore
    decided not to clutter the output of the man command with the
    licensing terms for those man pages.
    
    Note that emacs needs no special directive to put itself in nroff mode
    for these man page files.  So as part of these changes I have removed

    doc: Remove extremely dated file describing PLplot
    
    Historically, abs.txt was a way to save unconverted parts of the
    texinfo documentation of PLplot that was transformed into the modern
    DocBook form of documentation.  But by 2004 this file had degenerated
    into just a description of PLplot.  This file has not been changed
    since, that description is now quite incomplete, and we have different
    ways (e.g., the README file in the top-level deirectory) to describe
    PLplot in any case.  So remove this file.

    Use kind=plint integer constants in f95 examples
    
    This large and intrusive change was implemented by several sed scripts
    that implemented successive approximations followed by some hand
    editing to make further small corrections where the sed scripts
    did too much.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (gfortran compiler) using the test_diff_psc target.  And where f95
    results differed from C results (because propagation of C changes has
    not been done yet), also checked the f95 results were identical with
    the java results (where propagation has also not occurred yet).

    In f95 examples replace indefinite integer type for variables with
    kind=plint integer type
    
    This change was implemented by the following commands:
    
    for FILE in *; do
        echo $FILE
        sed --in-place -e 's?integer\([ ,]\)?integer(kind=plint)\1?' $FILE
    done
    
    Followed by hand-editing x23f.f90 to revert the above change for one
    comment that contained "integer " and hand-editing that and a few
    other examples which contained affected subroutines that required
    "use plplot" statements to define plint.

    Increase protection against implicit typing for the f95 binding
    
    I have widely increased the use of the "implicit none" statement so
    that it essentially appears after every use of "use" statements.
    
    This change found one implicit type (maxlen in the plplot_str module)
    which I have fixed with this commit.  Prior to this change, subroutine
    arguments could be misspelled without any warnings about implicit
    typing.  This wider deployment of "implicit none" found no instances
    of that case, but protects against that happening for any future
    change to existing subroutine and also provides suitable templates
    for all future added subroutines.
    
    I also have taken this opportunity to remove some implicit none statements
    that did not occur just after "use" statements.  These all occurred
    after the "contains" statement.  Experiments with deliberate
    misspellings of arguments showed that all code after the "contains"
    statement was already protected by the implicit none statement for the
    whole (plplot) module, i.e., these individual implicit none statements
    after the "contains" statement were not needed.  So for the sake of
    consistency (and therefore providing a clear template for future
    changes after the "contains" statement) I removed these unneeded
    implicit none statements.

Author: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
Date:   Fri Oct 10 11:36:24 2014 -0700

    Changed internal module names for f95 bindings
    
    The changes were as follows:
    
    plplot_types ==> plplot_graphics
    plplot_flt ==> plplot_types
    
    These new names just seem better chosen to me.  The old "plplot_types"
    module actually referred to a graphical element type, and
    the old plplot_flt module refers to type of real and types of integers rather
    than the type of just real.
    
    This is formally a backwards incompatible API change, but in my
    opinion users should uniformly be using "use plplot" and leave the
    details of how we name and define our other Fortran modules that are
    "used" by the plplot module to us.

    Rename some source files for the f95 bindings
    
    The new names just make more sense to me.  "configurable.f90" wasn't
    configurable so I renamed that plparseopts.f90 for the name of the one
    subroutine in it and "sfstubs.f90" was a fortran include file so I
    renamed that to sfstubs.inc to remind of that important distinction.

    Convert f95 bindings to replace generic integer type with integer(kind=plint) as discussed on list
    
    This change mostly required just sed editing to automatically convert
    integer\([^(]\) to integer(kind=plint)\1
    
    However, this change also required some file reorganization of the
    Fortran source code for libplplotf95.  sfstubsf95.f90 depends on a
    module defined in strutil.f90 so if strutil.f90 depends on the
    plplot_flt module defined in sfstubsf95.f90 that creates a circular
    file dependency which gfortran (and probably other Fortran compilers)
    cannot handle.  To break this circular dependency I removed the
    definition of the plplot_flt module from sfstubsf95.f90 and instead
    defined the plplot_flt module in a separate configured source file
    called plplot_types.f90.in which effectively contains the modified
    contents of the previous include file plflt.inc.in which is no longer
    used and which is therefore removed.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (i.e., with the gfortran compiler) using the test_f95_psc
    target.
    
    To Do:
    
    (1) Look for any integer constants in the Fortran 95 source code for
    bindings/f95 that should be changed e.g., from 1 to 1_plint.
    
    (2) Do some renaming of source files and modules using a
    more consistent naming scheme.
    
    files:
    configurable.f90 ==> plparseopts.f90
    sfstubs.f90 ==> sfstubs.inc
    
    modules:
    plplot_types ==> plplot_graphics
    plplot_flt ==> plplot_types
    
    (3) integer type and constant changes in the f95 examples.

    Modify recent commits concerning Tcl testing on Windows
    
    These changes were the following:
    
    (a) The Cygwin, MSYS, and MinGW build-system path logic was left as it
    was before Phil's recent changes (except for Phil's blank in path
    changes) since that path logic was previously extensively tested
    on the given platforms.
    
    (b) Change to a style where the platform is determined by CMake
    as opposed to running uname at the bash level to determine the
    platform.
    
    (c) An attempt was made to keep all of Phil's changes for the MSVC
    case in the configured test_tcl.sh file.  There were some exceptions however.
    
    I. native_windows=true was dropped.  I could not find any reference to
    that with google so I suspect setting that in bash does nothing.  But
    if it does anything, it is possible this is the source of the
    difficulty with the drive letter logic experienced by Phil on Cygwin.
    
    II. PLTCL_DIR_NATIVE=$PLTCL_DIR was dropped since apparently that
    variable is not used.
    
    III. Dropped the extra cd "$EXAMPLES_DIR/tcl" commands.  Instead
    the script uniformly uses cd "$tcldir" which is consistent with
    the design of the script before Phil's changes.  If something
    special has to be done for the MSVC platform case, then
    tcldir should be set appropriately in plplot-test.sh.in depending
    on the value of PLATFORM=@PLATFORM@ in similar style to the
    current changes in plplot_test/test_tcl.sh.in.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux using
    the test_tcl target in the build tree where the build-tree path had no
    blank in the name.  Note, the test_tcl target currently fails if there
    is a blank in the build-tree name, but I presume that is because Phil
    is not done yet with sorting out the "blank-in-build-tree-name"
    issues.

    Treat most text file line endings as LF in repository and native in
    working directory
    
    This change means that almost all of our text files will have LF
    endings in the repository and native (LF on Unix and CRLF on Windows)
    line endings in the working directory.
    
    The text file exceptions are *.sh and *.sh.in which are treated as LF
    both in repository and in the working directory so that these bash
    shell scripts will work on both Unix and Windows.
    
    Also, just in case the git heuristic for classifying whether a file is
    binary or text is making the wrong classification of a file as text
    when it is actually binary, specifically classify a number of file
    patterns as binary.  These file patterns were determined by looking at
    "svn proplist --verbose --recursive" results for the entire source
    tree of our last svn revision for svn trunk and searching for
    "application/octet-stream" in the results.
    
    Note this change in .gitattributes (when combined with the rest of the
    git commands that are recommended for each .gitattributes change by
    the gitattributes man page) found four additional text files where
    CRLF line endings had crept into the repository version. This commit
    fixes those issues as well.

    Update and document top-level .gitignore
    
    I added patterns to ignore temporary files created by emacs and also
    some files created by Python in the source tree.
    
    In most cases I was also able to document why we have told git to
    ignore these file patterns.

    Change line ending handling for *.sh, *.sh.in, *.txt, and *.cmake files
    
    *.sh and *.sh.in were changed to eof=lf to force LF endings in all
    cases for those files, and *.txt and *.cmake were
    changed to text=auto to for LF in repository and native on checkout.
    Note, this last change caught some LF errors in two files.  The
    plplot_test/CMakeLists.txt file was a known issue with a recent commit,
    but the CMakeDInformation one was a complete surprise.  Which
    shows how easy it is for line endings issues to creep in.

    Bump minimum CMake version for epa_build to 3.0.2
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux using
    the build_all target for the -DBUILD_THE_BUILDTOOLS=ON case and
    the build_ndiff, build_docbook-xml, build_docbook-xsl, and
    build_plplot_lite targets for -DBUILD_THE_BUILDTOOLS=OFF.  These
    targets cover all cases where the minimum CMake version is set, except
    for xmlcatalog-wrapper (only used for the Windows case) which is such
    a simple build that there should be no CMake versioning issues for it.
    
    Future plans with regard to the minimum version of CMake. Although
    this comprehensive update to a uniform minimum version of CMake is
    worthwhile for the epa_build project, it turns out that the
    CMake-3.0.2 version of ExternalProject.cmake still requires a small
    patch in order to work for *.tar.xz files (used for many of the
    epa_build downloads).  So epa_build still must contain its own patched
    version of ExternalProject.cmake, but I will attempt to convince the
    CMake developers to apply the tar.xz patch (which is already part of
    their master branch) to one of their releases so I can drop
    ExternalProject.cmake from epa_build while simultaneously bumping all
    its CMake minimum version requirements to whatever first release
    provides an acceptable version of ExternalProject.cmake.

    Fix non-existent target issue for build system for installed examples
    
    The issue was that tclIndex_tcl and tclIndex_tk only exist as targets
    for the core build and not for the installed examples build where the
    corresponding files are just installed without generated installed
    targets.
    
    Also explicitly set CMP0046 to NEW to find any future problems with
    non-existent targets.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    using CMake-3.0.2 by running cmake for the core build and after installation
    running cmake for the installed examples build.  No errors concerning
    non-existent targets were detected.

    This fix solves an issue on Linux where symbols such as vectorize

    the case of a shared library/static devices build.
    
    This fix should solve one of the issues reported at
    <https://sourceforge.net/p/plplot/bugs/149/> for the Cygwin platform
    and may solve all of them.

    Replace epa_build of Qt5.2.1 with epa_build of Qt5.3.1
    
    By skipping some additional modules that are not necessary for PLplot
    support, got the build time down to less than 20 minutes.
    
    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux by
    building PLplot against this qt5_lite (5.3.1) version (using the
    -DPLPLOT_USE_QT5=ON cmake option) and by checking reasonable run-time
    results were obtained for all qt devices (qtwidget, bmpqt, jpgqt,
    pdfqt, pngqt, ppmqt, svgqt, and tiffqt) when running the test_all_qt
    target (which also runs the test_qt_example target).  These qt device
    driver results that depend on Qt5 still have vertical character
    alignment issues, but the uniform large (more than half a character
    height) offset that was worked out to compensate for that Qt5 bug for
    Qt5.2.1 still seems to work for this Qt5.3.1 case.

    Adopt patched version of CMake master branch ExternalProject.cmake
    
    This file was taken from the CMake master branch (commit 2588dca),
    then patched with
    http://cmake.org/gitweb?p=cmake.git;a=commitdiff;h=9f49ac3d
    "ExternalProject: Avoid infinite loop on file download hash mismatch".
    
    This infinite loop fix should get into the next CMake-3.0.x release so
    eventually we will no longer need to carry this file with epa_build.
    But for now we do carry it as a convenience for our CMake-2.8.x users.

    and language bindings of that library, and LIB_TAG cleanout.
    That cleanout is part of a larger project to remove all mention

    Only do try_compile concerning HAVE_SAHOOKS if the information is not
    cached already.
    
    This is supposed to happen in any case according to CMake
    documentation, but does not.  So for the --debug-trycompile case
    (which explicitly does not clean up CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp after each
    try_compile) cannot follow documentation suggestion to simply remove
    from the cache the try_compile result you want to debug.  Therefore,
    have to put in an explicit if statement checking the existence of the
    cache value for all try_compiles to make that suggestion work.

    Implement test_tcl and test_tk targets.
    
    These new targets facilitate Tcl/Tk testing.
    
    The test_tcl target depends on all Tcl-related targets that have
    nothing to do with Tk.
    
    The test_tk target depends on the remaining Tcl/Tk targets.

    Added quotes to Tcl include paths to permit installation of Tcl in a path with spaces. Note that CMAKE deals fine with libraries with spaces. The quotes are only required for include paths because we prepend -I to them and pass them as compiler flags.

    The file edits included tracking down every instance of "svn" and

    took this opportunity to document the new options for rsync that
    give a clean upload of the website with (I hope) no known
    permissions problems for the next time someone else tries
    to generate and rsync the website.

    Switch to a different OCaml Cairo binding ("cairo2" in opam)
    
    This is a more actively maintained binding to the Cairo library.  It is
    unfortunately not packaged for Debian at this time so interested users
    would need to install the library through opam.  opam is generally the
    recommended way to install and manage OCaml libraries (this cpan, pip, etc)
    so this isn't a particularly serious limitation.

    Add epa_build configuration for libLASi.
    
    Tested on Linux using the build_libLASi target.  That target
    configures, builds, installs, and tests (via ctest) libLASi. The ctest
    results look fine except that the detailed PostScript file results for
    the second example are different each time that example is run as
    discussed on the lasi-devel list.  It appears the font commands at the
    head of the PostScript file are created in different order with
    different names, but the results look visually identical (as expected
    if just the font order is changed each time).  So this bug is more a
    curiosity than not, but nevertheless it would be good to deal with it
    so that the second example produces file-identical results each time
    rather than different random orders of fonts.

    Make harbuzz epa_build package depend on freetype_nohb to break the
    dependency loop between harbuzz and freetype as suggested by Linux
    from scratch.  The result is freetype depends on harbuzz which depends
    on freetyp_nohb where the two freetype packages are identical (except
    for the package name and except for the --without-harfbuzz configure
    option for freetyp_nohb.  Furthermore, installed file names are
    identical between the two freeype versions.  Thus, the freetype
    install completely overwrites the freetype_nohb install.  The result
    is that ldd -r shows libharfbuzz resolves symbols in libfreetype and
    vice versa without errors.  This illustrates the fundamental dependency loop
    between these two libraries which is allowed but is nevertheless a
    configuration pain that has been resolved as above.
    
    Tested on Linux by building the build_freetype package and running ldd
    -r on the resulting libfreetype and libharfbuzz libraries.

    Tighten up plInBuildTree logic.  Test that the current directory is
    exactly the same as the top-level build directory or a subdirectory of
    that directory.  (The old logic did not distinguish say build_dir from
    build_dir_install since the first letters of "build_dir_install"
    coincided with "build_dir".) The subdirectory logic implies searching
    for the path delimiter, so make sure that is appropriately designated
    for the different Unix and Windows path delimiters.  Finally, make the
    whole path name comparisons independent of case on Windows platforms
    (as opposed to the old code which only make the drive letter case
    insensitive).
    
    Lightly tested on Linux and MinGW/Wine.  More comprehensive
    testing is requested.

    Use specific (bash) shell for the traditional (Makefile + pkg-config)
    build system Makefiles for the installed examples.
    
    This solves potential bugs where bashisms in these Makefiles would
    lead to errors for systems where the default shell used by by the make
    command is not bash.

commit c9c95754ee506c03f0e2e3d12d8eebff81bdff77
Author: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
Date:   Sun May 18 21:59:51 2014 +0000

    Store all results of the examples run by ctest in their own unique
    subdirectory of the build tree.  This keeps the plplot_test
    subdirectory much cleaner, and makes it easy to implement a clean
    and quick way to remove all those ctest-generated files.
    
    This change solves two bugs with the old method of removing all the
    generated files using a list of filenames; that method was inexact
    (the list of filenames was incomplete) and more seriously also ran
    into command-line length issues for the cmd environment used for the
    "MinGW Makefiles" generator case.

Author: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
Date:   Sun May 18 21:53:26 2014 +0000

    Put test_noninteractive target example results in their own exclusive
    directory in the build tree which keeps the examples subdirectory of
    the build tree much cleaner and makes it easier to see how well the
    "make clean" command is cleaning up these files.
    
    The test_teclsh_standard_examples target has a showstopper Tcl exit
    problem (a non-zero return code) for certain configuration conditions
    (non-dynamic devices) on Windows.  Therefore, to keep this showstopper
    error from propagating to the overall testing target,
    test_noninteractive, drop including the test_tclsh_standard_examples
    target as part of the list of dependencies for that overall target on
    Windows until this additional Tcl exit issue can be addressed.

    As a trial possibility we use a binary downloaded version
    of gtk+ on Windows.
    
    Tested for the "MinGW Makefiles" generator on Wine-1.6.1.  cmake
    apparently configured the cairo devices without issues so that
    is a step forward for Walt Brainerd where this was a showstopper.
    However, at least on Wine, the gdi.dll
    library causes issues at "make install" time with the message
    
    c:\windows\system32\gdi32.dll: file not recognized: File format not
    recognized
    
    So this trial is a work in progress.

    tree for both the traditional and CMake-based build systems for that

    PLPLOT_USE_QT5 case other than the disabling of pyqt4 for this case.
    
    Tested on Linux using the comprehensive test procedure (which tests
    all three build systems mentioned above for each of our 3 fundamental build
    configurations, i.e., shared libraries/dynamic devices, shared libraries/static
    devices, and static libraries/static devices).

Date:   Mon Apr 21 00:26:11 2014 +0000

    Implement and use (in the CMake-based build system for the installed
    examples) a cmake-packages approach as documented at
    <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/git-next/manual/cmake-packages.7.html>
    for handling the CMake export of information concerning the PLplot
    libraries.  This change in approach allows finding Qt5 automatically
    as part of the CMake package configuration file.  That solves a
    linking issue with the previous approach when exporting a static
    version of the plplot library that depends on Qt5.
    
    Also refine the condition under which qt_example is tested both
    for the core build and the CMake-based build of the installed
    examples.

    Fix an integer overflow by only calculating physical coordinates of
    the origin of the axes when those additional axes are actually used
    (i.e., when the "a" option is specified and the drawn axis is
    going to be inside the viewport).
    
    This fix solves an integer overflow issue discovered by Hazen for page
    5 and larger for example 29 where the 0., 0., world coordinates of the
    unused axes generated with plbox were so far from the actual X
    world-coordinate range of the plot that integer overflow occurred when
    calculating the unused physical coordinates corresponding the the
    0.,0., world coordinates of the axes origin.

commit 46355bfd18c010394b951a301bd9fedd5cae7fd7

    Apply empirically derived (using examples/python/test_circle.py) and
    examples/python/x02) vertical offset for all text for the Qt5 case.
    This vertical offset is substantial (greater than half the character
    box height) and roughly constant for most glyphs/fonts.  However, the
    final value was optimized for the light diagonal cross glyph in
    test_circle.py. That example shows that other glyphs (except for the
    well-known asterisk case which is vertically misaligned by font
    design) have a dispersion in vertical alignments that is larger than
    for cairo which in turn is larger than for qt with Qt4. Both those
    latter dispersion results were derived with no empirical vertical
    offset at all.
    
    An additional issue which confuses the issue concerning the best
    vertical alignment for qt with Qt5, cairo, and qt with Qt4 is the font
    selection for all those cases is different (as evidenced by different
    sizes/shapes of glyphs in all three cases and missing glyphs (i.e.,
    Korean for example 24) for the Qt5 case which are present in the other
    cases. I assume all these issues are due to Qt5 version 5.2.1 font
    selection and font alignment issues which will be addressed for future
    Qt5 versions.  And when those Qt5 fixes occur, this empirical vertical
    offset will have to be changed or else withdrawn (set to zero).

commit 588f6ddc918c75480add541f7a0d2585f6810175
Author: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
Date:   Mon Mar 31 23:38:37 2014 +0000

    Configure and test epa_build of qt5_lite.
    
    Tested on Linux by running the build_qt5_lite target for epa_build.
    That build of Qt5 took almost an hour (56 min) compared to a similar
    build of Qt4 which took roughly one fourth that time.  The issue
    appears to be that some of the configure options that allow dropping
    components of Qt4 for the epa_build of qt4_lite do not appear to be
    available (as yet) for Qt5.  There may be an opportunity
    to drop additional parts of the Qt5 build in the future because
    I missed a relevant configure option this time or because later
    versions of Qt5 may allow dropping more components of the build.
    But for now an hour build is acceptable.
    
    Build-time tests were done with PLplot configured with the -DPLPLOT_USE_QT5=ON
    option with qmake from the qt5_lite epa_build on the PATH.  That
    PLplot build had no showstopper issues, and running ldd -r on drivers/qt.so,
    bindings/qt_gui/libplplotqt.so, and  examples/c++/qt_example showed no
    linking issues.
    
    Run-time tests were done with PLplot configured and built as above
    using the test_all_qt target without any showstopper errors for the
    shared library case in the build tree confirming Andrew's similar good
    run-time test results with a system version (as opposed to epa_built
    version) of Qt5.
    
    One major rendering issue is all text appears to be vertically offset
    by half a character height compared to Qt4 results.  Fixing that issue
    is next on my agenda.

commit bf7c52b1c8c69e0ee03b2bd5ec797172f7031235
Author: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
Date:   Mon Mar 31 00:57:53 2014 +0000

    Fix up several comprehensive testing issues with epa_build.
    
    The wxwidgets-related tests are still individually implemented for all
    platforms and for the Windows case those tests are dependencies of the
    more comprehensive interactive test targets.  However, for the Unix
    case those dependencies have been dropped because of "forced mousing"
    issue that occurs with gtk+3 variant of wxwidgets that is beginning to
    be available (e.g., for epa_build) on Unix.
    
    Implement DROP_GTK_PLUS_2_BUILDS option (which defaults to OFF).  When
    that option is turned ON, all targets which are related to gtk+2 only
    are dropped.  This avoids build-time errors (for the static drivers
    case) or run-time errors (for the dynamic drivers case) due to
    clashes with gtk+3 libraries that are potentially used for other
    parts of PLplot (e.g., the cairo and wxwidgets device drivers).
    
    Tested on Linux using the build_plplot target of epa_build that is
    configured with -DCOMPREHENSIVE_PLPLOT_TEST_INTERACTIVE=ON and
    -DCOMPREHENSIVE_PLPLOT_TEST_NONINTERACTIVE=ON

commit c1a569284ced4158b08cbf27bde21286ab3dbd62
Author: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
Date:   Thu Mar 27 01:12:32 2014 +0000

    Add patched version of system __makeinfo__.m which uses the "schar"
    (signed character) type to write a documentation string to a temporary
    file.  This fixes an Octave issue
    <http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?41965> with the default
    "uchar" type for fwrite used by the system version of __makeinfo__.m.
    The result of that default type is all utf8 8-bit binary characters
    are replaced by nulls (which therefore truncates the output from
    the help command when the help string contains utf8 characters).  This truncation is eliminated
    by this patched version of __makeinfo__.m, but this file should be
    withdrawn again once octave fixes bug 41965 and that fix propagates
    to most octave installations.
    
    Tested on Linux with octave 3.6.2 by changing directory to the top of
    the build tree, setting the octavedir environment
    variable
    
    export
    octavedir=bindings/octave:../plplot_allura/bindings/octave/PLplot:../plplot_allura/bindings/octave/PLplot/support/:../plplot_allura/bindings/octave/misc/:
    
    , and then executing the following octave
    commands inside an octave session:
    
    addpath(getenv("octavedir"));
    plplot_stub;
    help plot3dcl;
    
    The latter command gave the full expected utf8 help for plplot3dl without
    truncation.

Author: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
Date:   Tue Mar 18 03:13:46 2014 +0000

    Disable the octave binding for both plplot and plplot_lite.  There is
    no epa_build of octave yet.  Furthermore, non-epa_built versions of
    octave will have many dependencies that are likely to clash with the
    versions of the other PLplot dependencies that are epa_built.
    
    For the plplot (as opposed to plplot_lite) case on the Windows platform
    exclude the pango and qt4_lite dependencies and disable the
    corresponding PLplot capabilities because pango, qt4_lite, and all
    their dependent packages do not epa_build correctly yet on Windows.
    
    Thus, on Windows the only difference between plplot and plplot_lite
    at the moment is the former has a dependency on the wxwidgets epa_build
    and allows the corresponding wxwidgets device driver to be built
    and tested.
    
    On Unix, the differences between plplot and plplot_lite are larger;
    the former has a dependency on wxwidgets, pango, and qt4_lite
    and allows the corresponding PLplot capabilities to be built
    and tested.

    Update build from wxwidgets version 2.8.12 (which does not run correctly

    Add epa_build configurations for gtk+ and all its dependencies that are

    a somewhat "lite" version of gtk+ where the wayland dependency
    and installed tests have been disabled.

    Tested on Linux using the build_gtk+ target.  The resulting build was
    a success (no obvious build errors) and required 23 minutes on my

    Straighten out the dependency mess for glib and gt-doc.
    
    gtk-doc has a real dependency on glib so must add that dependency to
    gtk-doc.  But that normally would introduce a circular dependency since glib
    depends on gtk-doc!  So in addition to the gtk-doc package
    change, fix that circular dependency by disabling use of gtk-doc for
    glib, and dropping the dependency of glib on gtk-doc.

    Use improved placement for the block of CMake code that might in the
    future create a dependency on the moc_outfile_generated target which
    is now available for both the Qt4 and Qt5 cases.  Note this changed
    placement currently has no practical effect and is only for didactic
    reasons since this actual block of code is currently not executed
    (ANY_QT_DEVICE and NOT ENABLE_qt cannot currently be simultanously
    true).

Author: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 14 04:38:18 2014 +0000

    For the Qt5 case set PLD_epsqt to OFF since Qt5 does not support
    PostScript.
    
    This change requires rearrangment of the logic so
    that the order of the variable processing changes from
    
    ANY_QT_DEVICE ==> ENABLE_qt ==> PLPLOT_USE_QT5
    
    to
    
    ENABLE_qt ==> PLPLOT_USE_QT5 ==> ANY_QT_DEVICE.
    
    Visual inspection of the code appears to indicate there should be no
    issues with this new order.

    This fix allows the test_tclsh_standard_examples target to work on

    Solve scaling issue (https://sourceforge.net/p/plplot/bugs/143/)
    demonstrated by the extXdrawable_demo application.  Thanks to
    Jens (https://sourceforge.net/u/jensplplot/profile/) for reporting
    this issue which I was able to confirm by attempting to resize
    the extXdrawable_demo GUI.
    
    I have applied the fix suggested by Jens which in retrospect is
    obvious; when you change the geometry by resizing the window, the
    result is reported back by the call to XGetGeometry, and the scale
    factor must be adjusted to compensate for that changed geometry right
    after that call. After this fix, resizing the extXdrawable_demo GUI
    produced no strange line artifacts (presumably caused by short
    overflows) that were present before the fix.

commit 04397208e138e5fb0d542a01ff7edda531288f51
Author: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
Date:   Wed Mar 5 20:19:04 2014 +0000

    Fix long-standing memory management issue discovered accidentally by a
    valgrind run on plserver.
    
    The argv argument to main is an array of argc + 1 pointers.  The first
    argc of these point to NULL-terminated strings while the last is a
    NULL pointer (according to both Linux and Windows documentation of
    main that I have read).
    
    Tk_ParseArgv follows this same standard (i.e., writes a NULL
    pointer as the argc element of the argv array) when it modifies argc and argv.
    
    Previously there was only room in myargv for myargc = original argc elements, but
    that has now been changed to argc+1, and that solves the memory
    management issue as expected.
    
    Writing a NULL just off the end of an allocated block of memory in the
    heap is generally not a good thing to do and this fix addresses that
    issue.  However, plserver has been reliable before this fix so it
    appears we were by accident escaping unscathed from this memory
    management issue.  So the practical effect of this fix will not be
    apparent at the moment, but plserver should be more robust against
    further changes which might have generated a segfault without the
    present memory management fix.

Date:   Tue Mar 4 19:11:54 2014 +0000

    Update Python and Octave documentation strings consistent with
    doc/docbook/src/api.xml.
    
    This update includes the following interrelated components.
    
    Update api2swigdoc.pl by forming a rename hash to keep track of the
    renaming that occurs in bindings/octave/plplot_octave.i, and using the
    renamed documentation names for the Octave documentation case.  This
    solves a bug that occurred in the previous version where documentation
    of the renamed octave functions was lost.
    
    Propagate the improved results from api2swigdoc.pl using the
    check_swig_documentation target and copying the comparison file
    generated with api2swigdoc.pl to
    bindings/swig-support/swig_documentation.i.  This is a major change to
    that latter file not only because of the api2swigdoc.pl changes but
    also because api.xml has been updated extensively since the last time
    the check_swig_documentation target was run.  For example, api.xml
    includes UTF-8 characters now so those have been propagated to
    bindings/swig-support/swig_documentation.i.
    
    The UTF-8 characters in swig_documentation.i trigger an Octave bug
    where help strings which include UTF-8 characters are displayed in a
    truncated fashion, i.e., only displayed up to the first such
    character.  Such truncated display is not a showstopper bug, but it is
    an annoyance.  We have now made an extremely simple test case not
    involving PLplot which shows the display bug, and Andrew is
    investigating that test case further.
    
    The UTF-8 characters in swig_documentation.i end up in the
    swig-generated file bindings/python/plplotc.py which causes run-time
    problems since that file has no encoding string on the first or second
    line (which is demanded by Python standards). Swig should give users
    control of the encoding of that file, but to work around that swig
    bug, I have created the _plplotcmodule_fixed custom target which uses
    sed (now required to build the Python binding of PLplot) to append "
    It uses coding: utf-8" to the first line of that file.
    
    Changed target depends (just in the build tree since the
    fixed plplotc.py is automatically installed with no
    further action required in the installed examples tree) from
    _plplotcmodule to _plplotcmodule_fixed.
    
    The result has been tested on Linux using the test_noninteractive and
    test_interactive targets in the build tree and also (using the
    CMake-based build system) for the installed examples tree.

    New findwxWidgets module taken from nightly build of CMake. This provides support for wxWidgets 2.9 and 3.0. It also attempts to get the selection of 32 and 64 bit libraries correct by checking CMAKE_CL_64, however, for me this doesn't work. I have added a check for generators ending Win64 which gives correct selection for visual studio, but currently the NMake genrator always gets the 32 bit version. I'm awaiting feedback from CMake devs.

commit 8e54eaa10ec9de6a0ee852607ae16dd972f91636
Author: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
Date:   Mon Feb 24 23:26:54 2014 +0000

    More simplification of the Octave build.
    
    Remove the generation (done by api2text.pl) of Octave text
    documentation files in bindings/plplot_octave_txt since those
    documentation files are no longer used to build the Octave binding.
    Instead, the on-line help for the Octave (and Python) bindings is now
    produced by swig using bindings/swig-support/swig_documentation.i.
    That file is generated using api2swigdoc.pl which was derived from the
    (now removed) api2text.pl script.
    
    These changes were tested on Linux using the method specified in
    README.Release_Manager_Cookbook to create and test the release tarball.
    That tarball creation includes generating all PLplot documentation
    and sticking it in the created tarball.

commit 00812e753db2392fcf8f0699afb40004a89d644b
Author: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
Date:   Mon Feb 24 20:06:57 2014 +0000

    As alluded to previously on list, remove $Id keyword from files and
    remove all svn:keywords properties and all "keywords" properties
    (historically set in error instead of svn:keywords) from files. This
    change should completely get rid of the previous issue that an svn
    commit would change some file contents and thus automatically
    (and unexpectedly) regenerate parts of the build.
    
    Tested on Linux using
    
    svn diff -x -w |grep '^[+-]' |grep -v Id |grep -v '+++' \
    |grep -v '\-\-\-' |grep -v Copyright |less
    
    to check for editing errors.
    
    Tested on Linux using the test_interactive and test_noninteractive
    targets in the build tree for the shared libraries/dynamic devices
    case. This test should test most source code, but does not test
    documentation files for any editing mistakes where we must rely on the
    previous test.

    As alluded to on list, drop use of keywords that potentially could
    be updated by svn.  In this case remove $Revision, $Author, and $Date.

    Quiet warnings about wide characters (due to UTF-8) in output.
    
    This change does not change the actual results for api.xml that includes
    UTF-8.

commit 646c2776c9f9c423c65a17c0c6fac62a4c2ff58e

    Additional simplification of the build system for the Octave binding
    of PLplot.
    
    I discovered that bindings/octave/plplot_octave_rej.h and
    bindings/octave/plplot_octave.h.in were not actually used any more by
    our modern swig-based build system for the octave binding of PLplot,
    so I removed those files and all references to them throughout our
    build system.
    
    Tested on Linux by running the test_octave_psc target.

commit 507bc0cb3587525aef6ba059f2ff26961f16c50e
Author: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
Date:   Tue Feb 18 21:07:37 2014 +0000

    Do long-neglected maintenance of parity_bit_check.sh, a script that
    checks for non-ascii files in the source tree, i.e., files which
    include characters with the parity bit set.  Note this check does
    not include files which are already well known to contain non-ascii
    characters.  In other words, this check only looks for unexpected
    non-ascii characters.
    
    Use the "svn export" command to create a clean directory tree that is
    checked for such files.
    
    Update the list of files (scripts/parity_bit_check.exclude) known to contain non-ascii characters.
    All these changes concerned source files which have been changed from ascii to
    UTF-8.
