This file contains a list of the major changes in PLPLOT.  It is best to look
through this file for new features, etc, until the new documentation is
complete.

I constructed this file by simply stripping off all the CVS (the source
maintenance program we use) commit messages from each file.  Those that
are common to all are handled separately to make it a bit less junky.

*****************************************************************************
PLPLOT 4.99e changes
*****************************************************************************

pdfutils.c:
 * Revision 1.6  1993/11/12  18:41:18  mjl
 * Substituted bit operations for some arithmetic ones, for faster, more
 * concise, and more portable code.

plbox.c:
 * Revision 1.9  1993/11/19  07:29:18  mjl
 * Changed the minimum distance a grid line must be from the boundary in
 * order for it to be drawn.  It was set before at 0.5 ticks (undocumented
 * and hardwired) and I changed this to 0.1 ticks while documenting it in the
 * code and making it easier to alter (but only through changing the source).
 * Maybe in the long term this should become a settable parameter.

plcore.c:
 * Revision 1.23  1993/11/15  08:38:35  mjl
 * Added documentation.  Fixed plflush to be callable from Fortran.
 * Moved plexit to this file and changed it to set nopause before issuing the
 * final end-of-page command.
 *
 * Revision 1.22  1993/11/07  09:07:38  mjl
 * Changed plflush() to call escape function if driver wants to handle
 * flushes itself.  Also found & fixed a bug in plcpstrm.

plctrl.c:
 * Revision 1.10  1993/11/15  08:39:05  mjl
 * Removed plexit().
 *
 * Revision 1.9  1993/11/07  09:08:14  mjl
 * Added user-settable exit handler (call plsexit to set).

plmeta.c:
 * Revision 1.21  1993/11/15  08:29:19  mjl
 * Now writes number of pages in file to beginning of file on each
 * new page.  For seeking to a specified number of pages before EOF.

plrender.c:
 * Revision 1.34  1993/11/15  08:42:15  mjl
 * Added code to support seeks to the specified number of pages before EOF.
 * Number is specified using "--", i.e. -b --3 to start 3 pages before EOF.
 * Also works while interactively seeking.

plserver.c:
 * Revision 1.14  1993/11/19  07:31:35  mjl
 * Updated to new call syntax for tk_toplevel().

ps.c:
 * Revision 1.19  1993/11/19  07:29:50  mjl
 * Fixed the bounding box maxima (bug reported by Jan Thorbecke).

scstubs.c:
 * Revision 1.16  1993/11/15  08:40:57  mjl
 * Added stub for PLSCOLBG.

tk.c:
 * Revision 1.17  1993/11/19  07:31:36  mjl
 * Updated to new call syntax for tk_toplevel().
 *
 * Revision 1.16  1993/11/15  08:31:16  mjl
 * Now uses tmpnam() to get temporary file instead of tempnam().  Also,
 * put in rename of dangerous Tcl commands just after startup.
 *
 * Revision 1.15  1993/11/07  09:02:52  mjl
 * Added escape function handling for dealing with flushes.

tkshell.c:
 * Changed to new argument syntax for Tk_CreateMainWindow for TK 3.4 and later.

xwin.c:
 * Revision 1.26  1993/11/07  09:02:33  mjl
 * Some minor optimizations.  Also added escape function handling for dealing
 * with flushes.

metadefs.h:
 * Revision 1.9  1993/11/15  08:31:37  mjl
 * Bumped metafile version number since now write pages info to header.

plplot.h:
 * Revision 1.47  1993/11/19  07:32:40  mjl
 * Added Convex support.
 *
 * Revision 1.46  1993/11/15  08:34:07  mjl
 * Prototype section completely reworked.  Now each prototype taken directly
 * from the definition (so includes variable names) and is accompanied by a
 * brief description of what the function does.  This makes the header file
 * much more useful as a quick reminder of the argument syntax for each
 * function (i.e. a poor man's manual).
 *
 * Revision 1.45  1993/11/07  22:49:00  mjl
 * Bumped version number to 4.99e.
 *
 * Revision 1.44  1993/11/07  09:03:22  mjl
 * Added prototype for plsexit, the new exit-handler setting function.

plplotP.h:
 * Revision 1.14  1993/11/19  07:41:52  mjl
 * define NO_ANSI_LIBC if on Convex (may be overkill but it works..)
 *
 * Revision 1.13  1993/11/15  08:34:23  mjl
 * Prototype section completely reworked.  Now each prototype taken directly
 * from the definition (so includes variable names) and is accompanied by a
 * brief description of what the function does.  This makes the header file
 * much more useful as a quick reminder of the argument syntax for each
 * function (i.e. a poor man's manual).
 *
 * Revision 1.12  1993/11/07  09:03:42  mjl
 * Added escape code for flush handling.

plserver.h:
 * Revision 1.6  1993/11/19  07:31:20  mjl
 * Fixed the prototype for tk_toplevel().

plstream.h:
 * Revision 1.18  1993/11/15  08:34:43  mjl
 * Documentation changes.
 *
 * Revision 1.17  1993/11/07  09:04:17  mjl
 * Added device variable to specify that driver wants to handle its own
 * flushes.

plstubs.h:
 * Revision 1.18  1993/11/15  08:35:22  mjl

PLPLOT 4.99d changes
*****************************************************************************

Note the old Changes.log file has been moved to the doc directory for
possible reference while writing the new manual.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALL SOURCE FILES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Revision x.xx  1993/07/01  22:13:35  mjl
 * Changed all plplot source files to include plplotP.h (private) rather than
 * plplot.h.  Rationalized namespace -- all externally-visible internal
 * plplot functions now start with "plP_".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALL DRIVERS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Revision x.xx  1993/07/31  07:56:46  mjl
 * Several driver functions consolidated, for all drivers.  The width and color
 * commands are now part of a more general "state" command.  The text and
 * graph commands used for switching between modes is now handled by the
 * escape function (very few drivers require it).  The device-specific PLDev
 * structure is now malloc'ed for each driver that requires it, and freed when
 * the stream is terminated.
 *
 * Revision x.xx  1993/07/16  22:11:23  mjl
 * Eliminated low-level coordinate scaling; now done by driver interface.
 *
 * Revision x.xx  1993/07/01  21:59:45  mjl
 * Changed all plplot source files to include plplotP.h (private) rather than
 * plplot.h.  Rationalized namespace -- all externally-visible plplot functions
 * now start with "pl"; device driver functions start with "plD_".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
plwind.c:
 * Revision 1.5  1993/09/17  06:44:40  mjl

 * to recover.

plsym.c:
 * Revision 1.7  1993/10/21  19:30:25  mjl

 * Revision 1.9  1993/07/31  08:18:34  mjl
 * Clipping routine for polygons added (preliminary).

plfont.c:
 * Revision 1.9  1993/09/08  02:40:16  mjl
 * Added search of INSTALL_DIR, passed in from makefile.  Directories
 * now can be specified without the trailing slash, and the path name
 * is built up correctly (I hope) on Unix, Amiga, and MS-DOS (so special
 * handling for passing strings with a trailing backslash is gone).
 *
 * Revision 1.8  1993/07/28  05:53:47  mjl

 * Same thing as last commit, only this time it's right.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  1993/10/12  21:32:38  mjl
 * Fixed bug in automatic setting of precision (it was too large by 1 place)
 * when exponent is placed separately.

plctrl.c:
 * Revision 1.8  1993/10/21  19:28:25  mjl
 * Minor bug fix.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  1993/10/18  19:44:50  mjl
 * Added functions to return fully qualified pathnames and/or executable

 *
 * Revision 1.6  1993/09/27  20:40:12  mjl
 * Added #include <string.h> to pick up prototype for strcat.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  1993/09/08  02:37:48  mjl
 * Added plGetName for building up file name specs out of path components.

 * Changed debugging code to print to stderr instead of stdout.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1993/08/09  22:18:56  mjl
 * Miscellaneous cleaning up.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1993/07/16  22:38:13  mjl
 * These include functions to shade between contour levels (currently using
 * a pattern fill).  Contributed by Wesley Ebisuzaki.

plcore.c:
 * Revision 1.21  1993/09/24  20:33:25  furnish
 * Went wild with "const correctness".  Can now pass a C++ String type to
 * most (all that I know of) PLPLOT functions.  This works b/c String has
 * an implicit conversion to const char *.  Now that PLPLOT routines take
 * const char * rather than char *, use from C++ is much easier.
 *
 * Revision 1.20  1993/09/08  02:36:47  mjl
 * Changed mapping driver interface initialization function to not bomb if
 * called before plinit().  Changed plcpstrm to work more robustly (some
 * saves were giving garbage).
 *
 * Revision 1.19  1993/08/31  20:14:30  mjl
 * Fix to plend1() so that prematurely aborted streams do not result in a
 * core dump.  Put font loading code before plsc->level is set to 1, to
 * prevent core dumps when fonts are not found.
 *
 * Revision 1.18  1993/08/18  20:33:22  mjl
 * Many changes to driver interface to properly modify the device window
 * based on orientation and coordinate mapping.  Orientation switches now
 * automatically set the device window so as to preserve the aspect ratio.
 * Ditto for coordinate mapping (only used when copying stream parameters
 * from one to another, such as used when dumping a plot to disk from the TK
 * driver).  Switched over to new page description variables mar, aspect, jx,
 * and jy, and deleted the old ones.  Added a variable widthlock that is set
 * when -width is used to modify the pen width, so that subsequent plwid()
 * calls are ignored.
 *
 * Revision 1.17  1993/08/11  19:19:03  mjl
 * Changed debugging code to print to stderr instead of stdout, fixed
 * up some minor type mismatches.
 *
 * Revision 1.16  1993/08/09  22:20:34  mjl
 * Fixed plcpstrm() so that it no longer sucks.
 *
 * Revision 1.15  1993/08/03  01:46:58  mjl
 * Changes to eliminate warnings when compiling with gcc -Wall.
 *
 * Revision 1.14  1993/07/31  08:17:37  mjl
 * Action for driver interface setup functions now deferred until after
 * plinit() called so that these can be set via command line arguments.
 * Drivers that request it can handle these directly.
 *
 * Revision 1.13  1993/07/28  05:53:23  mjl
 * Put in code to ensure all malloc'ed memory is freed upon exit.
 *
 * Revision 1.12  1993/07/16  22:35:05  mjl
 * Addition of driver interface function for converting between device
 * coordinate systems, functions for retrieving current driver interface
 * parameters.  Also added functions for creating a new stream, copying
 * an existing stream, replaying the current plot, returning a list of
 * file-oriented devices.
 *
 * Revision 1.11  1993/07/01  22:25:16  mjl
 * Changed all plplot source files to include plplotP.h (private) rather
 * than plplot.h.  Rationalized namespace -- all externally-visible
 * internal plplot functions now start with "plP_".  Moved functions
 * plend() and plend1() to here.  Added driver interface -- sits
 * between the plplot library calls and the driver to filter the data in
 * various ways, such as to support zooms, page margins, orientation
 * changes, etc.  Changed line and polyline draw functions to go through
 * this layer.  Changed all references to the current plplot stream to be
 * through "plsc", which is set to the location of the current stream (now
 * dynamically allocated).  A table of stream pointers (max of 100) is
 * kept to allow switching between streams as before.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  1993/04/26  19:57:58  mjl
 * Fixes to allow (once again) output to stdout and plrender to function as
 * a filter.  A type flag was added to handle file vs stream differences.

plcont.c:
 * Revision 1.9  1993/07/17  21:31:55  mjl
 * Improved error message for out of range indices.

plbox.c:
 * Revision 1.8  1993/09/24  20:33:23  furnish
 * Went wild with "const correctness".  Can now pass a C++ String type to
 * most (all that I know of) PLPLOT functions.  This works b/c String has
 * an implicit conversion to const char *.  Now that PLPLOT routines take
 * const char * rather than char *, use from C++ is much easier.

plargs.c:
 * Revision 1.13  1993/08/28  06:38:05  mjl
 * The option table now requires passing of a pointer to user-defined data,
 * similar in spirit to that used in Xt or TK callbacks.  If unused, simply
 * initialize as NULL.  All option handlers changed to accept this pointer
 * as the third argument.  Especially useful from C++ for passing the "this"
 * pointer.
 *
 * Revision 1.12  1993/08/18  19:19:44  mjl
 * Added new flags -mar, -a, -jx, -jy for setting margin, aspect ratio, and
 * justification from the command line.  These are similar but not the same
 * as the same-named variables from old versions of plrender, and are treated
 * entirely different.  These now are used to set device window coordinates
 * in the driver interface.  The aspect ratio defaults to 0 for the natural
 * aspect ratio of the device, and the user normally won't need to change
 * this (plots requiring a specified aspect ratio should use plvpas or
 * plvasp).  The margin (0 to 0.5) is the *minimum* fraction of the page to
 * reserve on each side, while the justification (-0.5 to 0.5) is the
 * fractional displacement of the center of the plot in x (for -jx) or y (for
 * -jy).  Since these settings are now handled in the driver interface, ALL
 * output drivers now support margins, aspect ratio modification, and
 * justification.  The -wdev flag introduced only a month or so ago was
 * eliminated.
 *
 * Revision 1.11  1993/08/11  19:21:58  mjl
 * Changed definition of plHelp() and plSyntax() to take a mode flag
 * as argument.  Currently used to govern handling of invisible options.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  1993/08/04  18:27:03  mjl
 * Modified -bg argument handler to strip leading '#' off hex color value if
 * present, to allow it to deal with TCL-style color values.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  1993/08/03  01:46:56  mjl
 * Changes to eliminate warnings when compiling with gcc -Wall.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  1993/07/31  08:16:12  mjl
 * Flags added to change plot window (-wplt), device window (-wdev).
 * Orientation flag (-ori) changed to use new driver interface.  Aspect flag
 * (-a) deleted.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  1993/07/28  05:54:29  mjl
 * Added support for -nopixmap option.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  1993/07/16  22:32:35  mjl
 * Fixed bug encountered when setting option via plSetInternalOpt().

pdfutils.c:
 * Revision 1.5  1993/08/11  19:20:03  mjl
 * Changed debugging code to print to stderr instead of stdout, plugged
 * a hole where possible failure of fwrite went undetected.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1993/08/03  01:46:55  mjl
 * Changes to eliminate warnings when compiling with gcc -Wall.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1993/07/01  22:07:38  mjl
 * PDF functions start with "pdf_".

scstubs.c:
 * Revision 1.15  1993/10/21  19:27:07  mjl
 * Changed all names that ended with an underscore (as part of the C/Fortran
 * linkage) to end with a '7' instead, to avoid problems with f2c.
 *
 * Revision 1.14  1993/08/26  20:00:17  mjl
 * Inserted stub function PLINIT().
 *
 * Revision 1.13  1993/08/09  22:15:08  mjl
 * Eliminated all vestiges of old clr/page syntax, in favor of eop/bop.
 *
 * Revision 1.12  1993/07/02  07:11:39  mjl
 * Minor change to function name.
 *
 * Revision 1.11  1993/04/26  20:03:14  mjl
 * Added stub for plgchr().

sccont.c:
 * Revision 1.2  1993/10/21  19:27:06  mjl
 * Changed all names that ended with an underscore (as part of the C/Fortran
 * linkage) to end with a '7' instead, to avoid problems with f2c.

OTHER CHANGES TO DRIVERS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
xwin.c:
 * Revision 1.25  1993/10/01  23:18:33  mjl
 * Inserted XSync after creation of pixmap in CreatePixmap() to ensure
 * the test for a bad allocation is really completed.
 *
 * Revision 1.24  1993/09/14  22:25:44  mjl
 * One of the safety checks was mistakenly commented out.
 *
 * Revision 1.23  1993/08/28  06:29:42  mjl
 * Added a safety check that the escape function pointer for resizes is
 * initialized, and moved some XSync commands (deep magic, don't ask).
 *
 * Revision 1.22  1993/08/11  19:22:23  mjl
 * Fixed warning under Sun's acc.
 *
 * Revision 1.21  1993/07/31  07:58:33  mjl
 * Several driver functions consolidated, for all drivers.  The width and color
 * commands are now part of a more general "state" command.  The text and
 * graph commands used for switching between modes is now handled by the
 * escape function (very few drivers require it).  The color initialization
 * was modified to work better with the TK driver, and the function to detect
 * grayscale displays made external for use from tk.c.
 *
 * Revision 1.20  1993/07/28  05:34:45  mjl
 * Added error handler to trap pixmap allocation errors, and switch to a
 * slower method (redraw) of refreshing window on exposes.  Also added
 * globally visible utility functions for converting between a PLColor and
 * an XColor, as well as other minor changes.
 *
 * Revision 1.19  1993/07/16  22:17:00  mjl
 * Added escape function to redraw plot (unlike resize, the window size remains
 * unchanged).  Changed draw functions to only draw to the pixmap during page
 * redraws.  Pixmap is then copied to the actual window when done, for faster
 * and more smooth response.
 *
 * Revision 1.18  1993/07/01  22:05:48  mjl
 * Changed all plplot source files to include plplotP.h (private) rather than
 * plplot.h.  Rationalized namespace -- all externally-visible plplot functions
 * now start with "pl"; device driver functions start with "plD_".  X driver
 * enhanced to plot to a specified window id.  A pixmap is now used for
 * handling expose events.  External entries for doing expose, resize, and
 * redraw events were created using the escape function (for use from TK
 * plframe widget).  The X-driver device data is now dynamically allocated,
 * for use by multiple streams.  The default size of the created X window
 * has been reduced some.

tek.c:
 * Revision 1.16  1993/09/14  22:25:15  mjl
 * Moved define of POSIX_TTY to plplotP.h since the SX-3 isn't POSIX-compliant.
 *
 * Revision 1.15  1993/08/03  01:46:42  mjl
 * Changes to eliminate warnings when compiling with gcc -Wall.
 *
 * Revision 1.13  1993/07/28  05:38:59  mjl
 * Merged with xterm code, and added code to handle Tektronix 4105/4107
 * (color) devices.  For now just the color index selection is supported.
 * Added code to change terminal line to noncanonical (cbreak) mode on
 * POSIX systems so that entered keystrokes (including <Backspace> and "Q"
 * from plrender) do not require a <CR> to be recognized.

ps.c:
 * Revision 1.18  1993/08/09  22:13:32  mjl
 * Changed call syntax to plRotPhy to allow easier usage.  Added struct
 * specific to PS driver to improve reentrancy.
 *
 * Revision 1.16  1993/07/16  22:14:18  mjl
 * Simplified and fixed dpi settings.
 *
 * Revision 1.14  1993/04/26  20:01:59  mjl
 * Changed time type from long to time_t.

plmeta.c:
 * Revision 1.20  1993/08/20  19:35:53  mjl
 * Deleted save of pen width at every page boundary.  Eventually I'll come up
 * with a better way to save the state.
 *
 * Revision 1.19  1993/08/11  19:18:05  mjl
 * Changed debugging code to print to stderr instead of stdout.
 *
 * Revision 1.18  1993/08/03  01:46:41  mjl
 * Changes to eliminate warnings when compiling with gcc -Wall.
 *
 * Revision 1.16  1993/07/16  22:13:48  mjl
 * Switched coordinates to standard meta coords.  Eliminated obsolete low-level
 * operations.  Added write of some state information (colors and pen width)
 * at the beginning of each page to aid seeking while in renderer.
 *
 * Revision 1.15  1993/07/01  22:00:51  mjl
 * PDF functions start with "pdf_".
 *
 * Revision 1.14  1993/04/26  19:57:48  mjl
 * Fixes to allow (once again) output to stdout and plrender to function as
 * a filter.  A type flag was added to handle file vs stream differences.

plbuf.c:
 * Revision 1.16  1993/09/28  21:25:08  mjl
 * Now discards the old temp file and opens a new one on each new page.  This
 * avoids a lot of problems redisplaying partially filled pages -- we can
 * just read to EOF without worrying about junk in the file from previous
 * writes.  The old method never did work perfectly.
 *
 * Revision 1.15  1993/09/27  20:33:51  mjl
 * Insignificant change to eliminate a gcc -Wall warning.
 *
 * Revision 1.14  1993/09/08  02:27:11  mjl
 * Inserted change to ensure that streams that do not own the plot buffer
 * cannot write to it (was causing problems on plot saves).
 *
 * Revision 1.13  1993/08/30  19:11:51  mjl
 * Fixed the damage incurred by my previous "fix".  Plot buffer now appears
 * capable of accurately and unobtrusively replaying partially filled pages.
 *
 * Revision 1.12  1993/08/28  06:28:07  mjl
 * Fixed escape function reads & writes to be consistent.  Added plbuf_rewind
 * function, which writes EOP's to the end of file to make sure that dicking
 * around with the window settings before the page is complete doesn't end in
 * a core dump.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  1993/07/16  22:12:17  mjl
 * Simplified and slightly changed behavior to support plot dumps to cloned
 * plplot streams.

mgr.c:
 * Revision 1.1  1993/08/03  03:21:55  mjl
 * Added contributions from Sergio Fanchiotti for use under Linux.

TK DRIVERS: (all new, so I've just included a description)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
tkshell.c:
 * Functions to handle creation & initialization of TCL interpreter and
 * main window.  Taken from source code for "wish", copyright follows:

# A demo of alternate plserver startup.  Just sketched out so far.

tk.c:
 * Revision 1.1  1993/07/02  06:58:37  mjl
 * The new TCL/TK driver!  Yes it's finally here!  YAAAAAAAAYYYYYYY!!!

tclIndex:
# Tcl autoload index file: each line identifies a Tcl
# procedure and the file where that procedure is
# defined.  Generated by the "auto_mkindex" command.

plplotP.h:
 * Revision 1.11  1993/10/06  19:52:57  mjl

 * NO_ANSI_LIBC is defined, and no longer define this by default for SunOS.
 * May require linking with -lansi on some systems (using acc).
 *
 * Revision 1.10  1993/09/24  20:33:16  furnish
 * Went wild with "const correctness".  Can now pass a C++ String type to

 * an implicit conversion to const char *.  Now that PLPLOT routines take
 * const char * rather than char *, use from C++ is much easier.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  1993/09/14  22:25:19  mjl

 * Minor fixes.
 *
 * Revision 1.30  1993/08/13  04:42:52  mjl

 * hope its really right now, because I'd just as soon never look at that
 * piece of code again.
 *
 * Revision 1.29  1993/08/11  19:29:27  mjl

 * interface.
 *
 * Revision 1.24  1993/07/02  07:19:21  mjl
