Notes: the intent behind these licenses is to ensure that PLplot continues
to evolve in a positive way, while remaining freely distributable.
Placing the library under the LGPL enables software developers to use the
PLplot library as an integral part of their product, even a commercial
product.  Under the conditions of the LGPL, however, the source code to
the library must remain freely available.  This means that if you modify
the library to better suit your purposes, you are required to distribute
those changes freely to the general PLplot user community.
