How to get a copy of plplot
---------------------------

This is just a brief note to help you get started.  If you are installing a
new version of plplot on your system, please refer to the installation
notes in the sys/<sys-name>/ directory.  There are also system-specific
Appendices to the plplot manual.


UNIX
----
On a Unix type system, it is best to just copy the source distribution and
build the library on your machine.  This is very easy to do with the
provided master makefile (system selection done via m4 macros).  See
sys/unix/README for more information.


VMS
---
[note this will change for the final 4.0 release]
On VMS the build is a bit complicated although a makefile is provided (uses
Todd Aven's MAKE/VMS, a PD make-like utility).  Here it's perhaps best to
just copy the libraries.  On either the IFS vaxen FUSION or SOLAR these are
located in DISK1:[MJL.LIB] as

 (libraries)	libplplotf1.obj   libplplotf2.obj   libplplotf3.obj
 (fonts)	*.idx	*.lkp	*.fnt

The fonts and library should be put in a directory with logical name "lib:".
The libraries are single precision ('float' in C) and are really just
concatenated object files (due to VMS linker problems with C, the standard
library file will not work with plplot).  You will need to link with the 3
plplot object files as well as sys$library:vaxcrtl/lib.

In the future perhaps these will be available by anonymous ftp.  Meanwhile a
guest account on SOLAR (also at IFS) may be available for copying purposes
only, to those who ask.

Note:  the X window driver is NOT included.  I do not know what libraries to
link with or how common they are on vaxen in general (e.g.  the vax I
currently use the most does not have any X libraries on it).  Send some mail
if you know more about this and want to use X under VMS.
