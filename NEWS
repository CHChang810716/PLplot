This is the 9th beta release (4.99i) of what will eventually become
the PLplot 5.0 distribution.  At this point I'm mainly trying to root out the
remaining bugs and system dependencies, but there will undoubtably be a
few improvements yet before the final version sees the light of day.

Please refer to the following files for more information:

README		General introduction, where to get more information, etc.
NEWS		This file
CHANGES		Log of changes to plplot in reverse chronological order.
ToDo		Describes what's on the agenda (no promises, however :-).
FAQ		Frequently answered questions.  
INSTALL		Installation notes

Also see the system-specific documentation under sys/<system-name>.
The manual is being updated!  More below.

You can get the PLplot distribution by anonymous ftp from:

	/anonymous@dino.ph.utexas.edu:/plplot

in either .zip or .tar.gz form.  The most up-to-date (not very, at this
point) manual (in .ps and .dvi form) and info document files are available
there as well.

**************************************************************************
Version 4.99i: Summary of major changes
**************************************************************************

Primarily a bug-fix release.  Major changes:

- Changed distribution status to GPL/LGPL.  See "Copyright".  Other
  administrative file name changes.

- Various small bugs in configure & build fixed.

- Bug in code to keep track of window world coordinates fixed (symptoms:
  core dump would occur after the 65th page if pleop() was used to end the
  page rather than pladv()).  Thanks to Ian Searle for providing a
  demonstration of the bug.

- Bugs fixed in core routines + TK driver handling of colormap when
  saturation = 0; i.e. grayscale plots.  Thanks to Radey Shouman for his
  help.

- Fixed a bug that was preventing the exponential label from showing up
  under certain circumstances (3-D plots).

- Conex device (tek emulator under DOS) driver support added in tek.c;
  contributed by Mark Olesen. 

- Bug fixed in X driver that was causing a "Bad Match" error upon startup
  on some systems.

- Postscript driver:
    Fixed bug in current point update after state change.
    Fix to allow cmap1 color selections to appear in grayscale;
    contributed by Radey Shouman. 

- Tk driver: Fix to allow a TK main window to be associated with each
  PLStream (so x14c now can use either the TK or DP driver), also fix to
  properly update plserver's X-driver when cmap state is
  changed.  Contributed by Radey Shouman.

- pltek: Now checks for the terminal type and provides some rudimentary
  decisions based on the TERM setting.  The xterm is unaffected, but with
  a terminal type of "tekterm", the 'Page >' prompt is printed on the
  graphics screen so that the plot can be seen without having pltek flash
  back to the text screen immediately.  Contributed by Mark Olesen.

- Updated DOS/EMX driver provided by Mark Olesen; see sys/dos/emx for
  more detail.

- Amiga driver: Updated to work with new version.  Now has configure
  script for SKsh users -- is now trivial to configure and build.  A
  fall-back Makefile is also provided.  Several bugs fixed, notably one in
  changing the screen mode.  A compiled version of the PLplot library
  (SAS/C 6.2, IEEE single precision floats, optimized) and plrender are
  now available in the ~ftp/plplot/amiga directory on dino.ph.utexas.edu.
