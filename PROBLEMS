This file is designed to keep track of various problem fixes and new
features being worked on for the current PLplot CVS MAIN HEAD version and
who is taking responsibility for following up on each item.

The items are divided into Essential and "Would be nice" (i.e., release
critical versus not) with each of those categories further classified into
minor or major effort required.

Essential, major effort required.
********************************

* The new Unix/Linux configuration scheme must be tested for as wide a
variety of Unix/Linux platforms as possible.  This is the responsibility of
everybody on the development team with access to different platforms.
(Several Linux environments, a limited Solaris environment, and a limited
OSF1 environment completed, but we need much more especially a Solaris
environment with tcl/tk)

Essential, minor effort required.
********************************

* PLplot documentation of python, java, etc., interfaces.  Alan

* Build our documentation on RedHat.  Alan

* sort out option implications for --disable-shared.  For example, we
cannot build dynamic drivers in this case, and this also kills python and
octave so sysloc.in should be adjusted accordingly.

* http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=1785861 documents
the many minor memory leaks found by valgrind throughout the dynloader area.
Anybody with good understanding of that code section?  Joao is planning to
make an internal pllib_end function called from plend where overall memory
that is allocated at pllib_init is released again.

* If x08.tcl (or any other multi-page example) is executed first, then the
first page is skipped.

"Would be nice", major effort required.
***************************************

* Get PLplot to work on Mac OS X and Cygwin platforms.  Have to wait for
libtool-1.5 tarball to be officially reinstated on ftp.gnu.org.  Current
rate of progress is 7 per day with 450 to go ==> time scale of November 2003
or so before we can make further progress.  At that point, if libtool-1.5
solves the major problems, there will probably still need to be some
additional work to smooth out minor configuration and cross-platform issues
for Mac OS X and Cygwin.

* Move from DSSL based docbook stylesheets to XSL.  Rafael, as soon as
the XSL results look as good (pdf currently a problem) as the DSSL results.

* Maurice's idea of plsopt and plsdopt so that our API doesn't keep
proliferating.  Example, instead of plenv0 do:
plsopt("plenv_advance", "0");
plenv(...)

* -the tk drivers ignore plconfig.tcl if it is in the user directory ~/tcl
and a tclIndex file is generated. "auto_path" is correctly initialized to
~/tcl, pwd/tcl, etc, but plconfig is not executed.  Reported by Joao.  Status?

* Completely remove configure.in and COPYING from the top directory of the
cvs repository.  (The cf/configure.in file is fine.) It's a long story, but
topdir configure.in is no longer used by PLplot (configure.ac is used
instead), and configure.in has a real log mess so AWI want to just get rid
of it entirely.  COPYING is another long story, but AWI needs to reuse that
name so he can provide a proper reference to our LGPL licensing.

* Maurice plans to finish his changes to implement handling strings as
strings in the metafile format.

* Geoffrey plans to at least evaluate remaining fidelity problems caused
by our 16-bit integer approach.

* Make plframe widget work for python/Tkinter front end.

* Parallelogram problem for rotation which is not multiple of 90 deg. This
is on the major list because Maurice doesn't think it will be simple to sort
this out. Once this problem is sorted out, it should be possible to deal
with the remaining rotation problems for the font handling, but those issues
should not be tackled until the parallelogram core problem is straightened
out.

* Uniform 3D API for handling z, x, y, and exclusion.  The shaded and
contour plots do this fairly well (although not uniformly), but the plot3d,
plmesh, and plsurf3d API's are much too simplistic for general work.  For
example, they don't handle non-rectangular x,y regions at all.

* Much more extended plarrows API.  Question on list about this as of 2003
September, but no decision made.

"Would be nice", minor effort required.
***************************************

* 2003-09-20: The generated info files should have their root name changed
from plplotdoc (plplotdoc.info, etc.) to plplot$version like the rest of the
generated files (plplot-5.2.1.cvs.20030915.dvi, etc.) Note this change would
require that packagers' scripts that execute install-info would need a
change to use the versioned name, but this should be straightforward to do
both for RedHat and Debian packages.

* 2003-09-20: References are not there in info bibliography section (chapter
14).  Tentatively classified as minor effort, but it may be a matter of
a major effort or merely wait for better backend software for docbook xml.

* plplot_general list 2003-08-26: Arjen Markus <arjen.markus@wldelft.nl> "I
have found that with the X Window driver the values returned by plgspa()
are/can be too small by a factor of approximately 1.4."  This should be
followed up by an attempt to confirm the bug, and if it is there, fix it.

* Error messages for when the extended search fails in tclAPI.c.  This is
required when running in tcl-only mode with no plframe or stack trace.

* As part of extended search try the install location.  We know exactly
where that is relative to our font data, and we know exactly where the font
data are installed so we know the absolute path to our tcl install location.
Then, the only way such an extended search would fail is if the packagers
messed with our tcl install location.

* Better support for "make check" so that uninstalled versions can check for
drivers, fonts, and tcl support scripts in their uninstalled positions.

* Permissions problem with generated plplot-config and plplot-test.sh in
plplot/test.  Using new autoconf API allows you to set permissions of results
so this will automatically get sorted out when we move to a modern autoconf
API.  Also, this issue only affects "make check" environment since the
installed versions should have the correct permissions using the autotools
approach.

* fortran examples made consistent with the C, C++, tcl, Java, python, and
octave examples as a test that the API is implemented correctly for each
front end and as a teaching device of how to produce *exactly* the same plot
for each front end.  C++, Java, python, and Tcl are consistent, but octave
is not (Joao?) and fortran needs a lot of work.

* fortran API used to be our most complete non-C interface, but now it has
fallen behind C++, python and java (and the swig-based perl interface that
has been developed as a separate project).  Alan

* Implement plgetopt for fortran so can do command-line processing. Probably
some cross-platform issues (especially with fortran) so have it act
reasonably when, e.g., getarg is not available on some fortran platforms.
