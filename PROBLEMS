This file is designed to keep track of various problem fixes and new
features being worked on for the current PLplot CVS HEAD version and who is
taking responsibility for following up on each item.

The items are divided into 4 lists that are classified as major (essential,
and "would-be-nice") and minor (essential, and "would-be-nice")

The "major" versus "minor" classification has nothing to do with the impact
of the item.  Instead, this classification is an attempt to estimate whether
a major or minor amount of work will be required to fix the problem, add a
feature, etc.  

The "essential" versus "would-be-nice" classification trys to estimate
whether the problem fix or new feature is release critical or not. 

Major, essential

*  Although additional help would be most appreciated, Alan is taking
ultimatate responsibility for getting the library linking in good shape
cross-platform.  This includes rationalizing the libraries some more, static
drivers on Linux, static libraries on Linux, plus generalization of the
Linux solution to cross-platform.

Major, "would be nice"

* Maurice plans to finish his changes to implement handling strings as
strings in the metafile format.

* Geoffrey plans to at least evaluate remaining fidelity problems.

* Make plframe widget work for python/Tkinter front end.

* Parallelogram problem for rotation which is not multiple of 90 deg. This
is on the major list because Maurice doesn't think it will be simple to sort
this out. Once this problem is sorted out, it should be possible to deal
with the remaining rotation problems for the font handling, but those issues
should not be tackled until the parallelogram core problem is straightened
out.

* There is still one issue holding back Olof et al from moving to our
supported python interface for their pyqt GUI work. They require two output
devices (one for the GUI and one to store results more permanently).  This
is possible with -dev tk.  If a simple solution for the pyqt GUI following
what is done for the plframe widget for -dev tk is possible, then this item
should be reclassified to minor, "would be nice"

Minor, essential.

* Alan has some documentation backlog to clear.

* If x08.tcl (or any other multi-page example) is executed first, then the
first page is skipped.

* tk cmap1 palette maniupulations no longer work.

* ./xtk02 -f tk02
invalid command name "Pltkwin"
    while executing
"Pltkwin .plw"
    (file "tk02" line 48)
    invoked from within
"source tk02"

and similarly for tk04.

* Permissions problem with generated plplot-config and plplot-test.sh in
plplot/tmp.  How do you get autoconf to generate the files with the correct
permissions?

* bindings/tk/plcolor.tcl has execute permissions that should be removed.
examples/tcl/stats.log should be made world-readable.  Both these permission
problems need access to the CVS repository to fix.

Minor, "would be nice"

* Alan plans to try to adjust our python interface from swig-1.3.1[1-3] to
swig-2.0 if that is released before the PLplot release.

* Joao is working on an update to plotfc3d.c to also have contour lines.
Definitely would be nice!

* Alan has documented on the plplot devel list (but cannot take
responsibility for) many minor memory leaks found by valgrind throughout the
dynloader area.  These should be cleaned up.

* Finish Java API or else completely reimplement it with swig (which might
be a much faster way of solving the problem).

* debian subdirectory made part of HEAD so can build debs directly
from HEAD.

* fortran, C++, and octave "x" examples made consistent with the C, tcl,
Java, and python examples as a test that the various front ends produce the
same results.
