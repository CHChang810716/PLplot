Things Geoff has noticed:

5 June 1995:

1) Build rules suck for PLplot exectuable programs--don't take
   advantage of the fact that when linked against shared libs, don't
   generally need to be relinked if the library changes.  Hey, that's
   what shared libs are all about!

2) Xwin driver still has a display bug.  In x01c, the second plot does
   not get the line drawn fully through the points, even though lots
   more gets plotted on the page.  An expose is required to get the
   whole thing drawn.  This on Linux under X11R6, ELF system.

3) Installation should be platform configurable.  Some linux users may
   want to have ldconfig run at installation time, like in David
   Engel's Tcl/Tk ports.  But I doubt this would be universally
   desired, since some (like myself) will install to a specified
   prefix, and use LD_ELF_LIBRARY_PATH, in which case ldconfig is not
   useful.  So this should be configurable somehow.  Maybe by using
   GNU make variable ifdeffing or some such...

4) None of the Tk demos work on Linux, using Tk4.0b3.  They all work
   as an acceptable wish, but when you try to pack a plframe, they
   segv. 

	FIXED:  Bogus Tk installation on my part, PLplot was
	#including tk.h from Tk 3.6, but linking against Tk4.0b3.
	Fixing my headers and rebuilding the lib, made all the
	executables work, w/o relink!  Shared libs are greaaaat!
	Well, not really my fault per se, JO changed the way the Tcl
	installs work, now headers go into a subdir, which is nice in
	general, but just happens to be a switch from prior versions.

5) Can't seem to run Tk driver on Linux.  Maybe a problem with xauth,
   but can't understand why I can't get it set up right...

6) More serious bugs in the X display engine.  In tk01 the cross hairs
   are leaving partial copies of themselves all over the place,
   especially the horizontal one,  replicating like mad.  All other
   tk0? demos, many more examples of partial draws, all cured by
   occluding/exposing the plframe. 

7) Serious problems with the rubberbanding.  In tk04, with the surface
   plot up, the zoom box is black, which is very hard to find.  Worse,
   it replicates itself, although much less frequently than the cross
   hairs.  Nevertheless, I have seen ghost boxes.  Worse--if the
   zoombox is pulled to extend partially outside the viewport, then
   replication/ghosting problems come back with a vengence.  Get
   gazillions of structures that look like brackets (]) where it is
   white for the part outside the viewport, black for the part inside.
   These ghost images remain until the zoom snap, or until an expose.
   Then the plot is redrawn correctly...

8) More rubberbanding nonsense.  In tk04, put the zoom point on one of
   the color balls, and pull out the edge.  Besides the box, a couple
   of teeny weeny little pixels in the center get changed to black,
   fixed by expose...
