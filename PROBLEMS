This file is designed to keep track of various problem fixes and new
features being worked on for the current PLplot CVS MAIN HEAD version and
who is taking responsibility for following up on each item.

The items are divided into Essential and "Would be nice" (i.e., release
critical versus not) with each of those categories further classified into
minor or major effort required.

Essential, major effort required.
********************************

* The new Unix/Linux configuration scheme must be tested for as wide a
variety of Unix/Linux platforms as possible.  This is the responsibility of
everybody on the development team with access to different platforms.
(Several Linux environments, a limited Solaris environment, and a limited
OSF1 environment completed, but we need much more especially a Solaris
environment with tcl/tk)

Essential, minor effort required.
********************************

* PLplot documentation of python, java, etc., interfaces.  Alan

* Build our documentation on RedHat.  Alan

* sort out option implications for --disable-shared.  For example, we
cannot build dynamic drivers in this case, and this also kills python and
octave so sysloc.in should be adjusted accordingly.

* If x08.tcl (or any other multi-page example) is executed first, then the
first page is skipped.

"Would be nice", major effort required.
***************************************

* Fix bad-looking surface contours for plsurf.  The problem goes away if the
plP_fill call is commented out in the normal series of alternating calls to 
plP_fill and plline3 that are used to generate the surface and the surface
contours.  So I conclude there is some inconsistency between the edge of
the triangles as defined for the surface contours plotted by plline3
and the edge of the triangles being filled.  Low resolution devices have
worse problems than high resolution devices.  Surface contours look bad
for png, better (but still not acceptable for publication) for psc, better
still for xwin, and I could not find any problems at all for tk.

* Move from DSSL based docbook stylesheets to XSL.  Rafael, as soon as
the XSL results look as good (pdf currently a problem) as the DSSL results.

* Maurice's idea of plsopt and plsdopt so that our API doesn't keep
proliferating.  Example, instead of plenv0 do:
plsopt("plenv_advance", "0");
plenv(...)

* Maurice's idea (plplot_devel 8 Jan 2004) of using C-style format specifier
for familying as in

./x08f -dev png -fam -fflen 2 -o x08f.%02d.png

* -the tk drivers ignore plconfig.tcl if it is in the user directory ~/tcl
and a tclIndex file is generated. "auto_path" is correctly initialized to
~/tcl, pwd/tcl, etc, but plconfig is not executed.  Reported by Joao.  Status?

* memory leak problems for -dev xwin, -dev tk, and -dev ntk. The
valgrind results for these interactive devices typically show lots of
alloced blocks of memory that have not been freed at exit. This might be
caused by my rather old versions of the X and Tk libraries not being
valgrind clean or it may be that our drivers do not properly close those
libraries.

* Maurice plans to finish his changes to implement handling strings as
strings in the metafile format.

* Geoffrey plans to at least evaluate remaining fidelity problems caused
by our 16-bit integer approach.

* Make plframe widget work for python/Tkinter front end.

* Parallelogram problem for rotation which is not multiple of 90 deg. This
is on the major list because Maurice doesn't think it will be simple to sort
this out. Once this problem is sorted out, it should be possible to deal
with the remaining rotation problems for the font handling, but those issues
should not be tackled until the parallelogram core problem is straightened
out.

* Put in index limits for the plot3d API's so they can handle
non-rectangular x,y regions.  This has already been done for plsurf and
needs to be extended to plot3d.

* Put in variation of "defined" callback function with user-defined data
for plshade and plshades.  Rafael?

* Put in "defined" callback function with user-defined data for for plcont,
plot3d, and plsurf.  This will supersede the non-rectangular x,y regions
change already done for plsurf and planned for plot3d, but this programming
is harder than those previous or planned changes so it will probably take
longer. Rafael?

"Would be nice", minor effort required.
***************************************

* 2003-09-20: The generated info files should have their root name changed
from plplotdoc (plplotdoc.info, etc.) to plplot$version like the rest of the
generated files (plplot-5.2.1.cvs.20030915.dvi, etc.) Note this change would
require that packagers' scripts that execute install-info would need a
change to use the versioned name, but this should be straightforward to do
both for RedHat and Debian packages.

* 2003-09-20: References are not there in info bibliography section (chapter
14).  According to Rafael this problem is caused by docbook2x not currently
supporting the <bibliomixed> and <bibliomset> tags so we will have to wait
for that to get sorted out.

* plplot_general list 2003-08-26: Arjen Markus <arjen.markus@wldelft.nl> "I
have found that with the X Window driver the values returned by plgspa()
are/can be too small by a factor of approximately 1.4."  This should be
followed up by an attempt to confirm the bug, and if it is there, fix it.

* Error messages for when the extended search fails in tclAPI.c.  This is
required when running in tcl-only mode with no plframe or stack trace.

* As part of extended search try the install location.  We know exactly
where that is relative to our font data, and we know exactly where the font
data are installed so we know the absolute path to our tcl install location.
Then, the only way such an extended search would fail is if the packagers
messed with our tcl install location.

* Better support for "make check" so that uninstalled versions can check for
drivers, fonts, and tcl support scripts in their uninstalled positions.
There has been improvement in this area, but can we now run make check
everywhere when nothing installed?  And when something installed, does
make check completely ignore it?

* standard octave examples should be made consistent with the C, C++, tcl,
Java, python, fortran, and even yorick (yplot) examples as a test that the
API is implemented correctly for octave and as a teaching device of how to
produce *exactly* the same plot for the octave interface as you can for each
of the other interfaces. Currently octave examples 2, 6, 7, 10, 12, and 18
agree with their counterparts from the other interfaces, but octave examples
1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 16 are not consistent.

* Use some well-recognized pdf verification tool (similar in spirit to the
w3c verification tests for web sites) to be sure our results conform to the
published pdf standards.  Currently there is no idea whether such a pdf
verification tool exists, but acroread is buggy on Linux so that is not good
enough as a verification tool.

* Replace all configure-related environment variables, e.g.,

JAVAMDINCDIR
GDINCDIR
CDINCDIR
FREETYPEINCDIR
TCLINCDIR
ITCLINCDIR
TKINCDIR
TKPRIVATEINCDIR
TCLPRIVATEINCDIR
PYTHON_INC_DIR

GDLIBDIR
PNGLIBDIR
JPEGLIBDIR
ZLIBLIBDIR
CDLIBDIR
FREETYPELIBDIR
TCLLIBDIR
ITCLLIBDIR
TKLIBDIR
ITKLIBDIR
VGALIBDIR

by documented ./configure options.
