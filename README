This is a first attempt at a remote installation of the PLplot website at
SourceForge, with the goal to replace the script replace-htdocs.sh,
currently in the shell.sf.net host. 

To install the web site, just type:

    USER=joeplplotter make install

and everything will be built and uploaded automatically, including the stuff
in the announce directory.

Sensible variables are defined in file Makefile-vars, which is included by 
both Makefile and announce/Makefile.

Needless to say, this only works with GNU make.

Caveat: make install will happily upload the entire contents of the
subdirectories.  This means that it may upload useless files, most notably
the CVS directories present when working from a cvs checked out source.
Using cvs export is more appropriate here, although the useless files will
not hurt the web site.  I may try to find a fix for this in the future.
