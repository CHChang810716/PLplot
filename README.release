This paragraph to to be removed for the final version.

This is a preliminary version of the notes for our next release.  In
this text ??? stands for numbers that will likely change for the final
version of these release notes.

PLplot Release 5.14.0 ???

This is a release of the PLplot plotting package. It represents the
ongoing best efforts (roughly 100 ??? commits since the last release) of
the PLplot development community to improve this package, and it is
the only version of PLplot that we attempt to support.  Releases in
the 5.x.y series should be available roughly two times per year.

Note that PLplot has been continuously developed since 1986 so it has
accumulated a lot of cruft since that time that we are now slowing
dealing with to improve the lot of both new users and new members of
the development team.  As a result virtually every PLplot release has
some backwards incompatibilities introduced to help clean it up so
please pay careful attention to the OFFICIAL NOTICES FOR USERS below
where we document such incompatibilities to make life easier
for those who have prior experience with older PLplot releases.

If you encounter a problem with this release that is not already
documented on our bug tracker, then please send bug reports to PLplot
developers via our mailing lists (preferred for initial discussion of
issues) at <http://sourceforge.net/p/plplot/mailman/>. If it turns out
no quick resolution is possible via mailing-list discussion, then the
issue should be placed on our bug tracker at
<http://sourceforge.net/p/plplot/bugs/>.

1. OFFICIAL NOTICES FOR USERS

1.1 CMake version compatibility

Our build system is implemented using CMake.  The minimum version of
CMake we allow is 3.6.2 ??? on all platforms.

This particular PLplot release has been comprehensively tested for
CMake versions 3.6.2 ??? through 3.9.1 ??? on a variety of platforms (see
<http://sourceforge.net/p/plplot/wiki/Testing_PLplot/#Testing%20Reports>).
So if your CMake version is <= 3.9.1 ??? and satisfies the above minimum
CMake version requirement there is an excellent chance that our build
system will work well.  Furthermore, if you try later CMake versions
as they are released during the life of this PLplot release, our build
system will likely continue to work well because CMake has an excellent
reputation for preserving backwards compatibility.  But if you get
build-system trouble for versions of CMake greater than 3.9.1 ???, the
first thing you should try is CMake-3.9.1 ??? which has been well-tested
by PLplot builds.

1.2 Remove Fortran cruft

As of PLplot-5.12.0, a new Fortran binding was implemented using the
powerful capabilities of the Fortran 2003 iso_c_binding module which
was the replacement for the old binding that was implemented using a
combination of Fortran and C code.  The new binding is much simpler,
more consistent, and more standards-compliant than the old binding and
has some powerful new features (e.g., both single and double
precisions Fortran floating-point arguments are accepted).  Therefore,
the new binding is necessarily backwards incompatible with the old
binding.  For PLplot-5.12.0 we implemented the CMake option
-DPL_DEPRECATED_fortran=ON to provide temporary deprecated access to
the old Fortran binding, and that form of backwards compatibility
continued to be provided for the PLplot-5.13.0 release.  However, it
appears our users are generally satisfied with the new binding, and we
no longer want to maintain or test that old binding.  So for this
release the old Fortran binding (and an old set of Fortran standard
examples that depended on it) has been completely removed from our
source tree.

1.3 Remove Tcl/Tk cruft

As of PLplot-5.12.0, a new Tcl binding was implemented that used the
"redacted" PLplot API where all dimension arguments for arrays are
dropped from argument lists since those data are redundant (already
supplied by the arrays themselves).  As a result of this change, Tcl
calls to the PLplot API in the old binding such as

$w cmd plline $nsize x y

now have to be replaced in the new binding by

$w cmd plline x y

and similarly for all other Tcl calls to the PLplot API that involve
array (tclmatrix) arguments.  The advantages of this new binding are
it is cleaner, it is safer (i.e., automatically self-consistent with
regard to array dimensions), and it makes our Tcl binding compatible
with the rest of our bindings.  (The only exception to this is our C++
binding which currently still uses simple C-style arrays and therefore
must use the non-redacted form of the PLplot API, but that may also
change in the future.)  However, the disadvantage of this change is
our new binding is obviously backwards-incompatible with the old
binding.  Therefore, for PLplot-5.12.0 we implemented the CMake option
-DUSE_NON_REDACTED_TCL_TK=ON to provide temporary deprecated access to
the old Tcl binding, and that form of backwards compatibility
continued to be provided for the PLplot-5.13.0 release.  However, it
appears our users are generally satisfied with the new binding, and we
no longer want to maintain or test that old binding.  So for this
release the old Tcl binding (and old versions of the Tcl standard
examples and Tk source code that depended on it) have been completely
removed from our source tree.

1.4 Remove plmap cruft

As of PLplot-5.9.10, a new version of plmap was implemented that used
shapefile format (accessed via shapelib) for maps.  In addition other
powerful map API (see the last page of standard example 19) that
depended on shapelib map data was implemented as well.  However, we
still made the old plmap implemention that depended on the
(undocumented) binary format of our *.map files available when the
user specified -DPL_DEPRECATED=ON, and this arrangement continued
through PLplot-5.13.0.  However, it appears our users are generally
satisfied with the new shapefile-based plmap functionality and we no
longer want to maintain or test that old plmap functionality based on
the *.map format.  So for this release that old plmap functionality
and associated *.map files have been completely removed from our
source tree.

1.5 Remove Perl/PDL examples

By historical accident and for just a limited time we actively
developed a set of standard examples written in Perl/PDL to help test
Doug Hunt's external PDL::Graphics::PLplot project.  But we have now
removed those examples from our project since we have long since
stopped testing PDL::Graphics::PLplot with those examples, and, in any
case, such examples should be part of the PDL::Graphics::PLplot package rather
than PLplot.

1.6 Remove all previously deprecated functions

I removed plParseInternalOpts, plSetInternalOpt, plclr, plpage, plcol,
plcontf, plP_gvpd, plP_gvpw, plotsh3d, plSetOpt, plrgb, plrgb1, plhls,
and plwid.  These functions were officially deprecated (i.e., only
accessible if the user specifed the -DPL_DEPRECATED=ON cmake option)
as of the PLplot-5.9.10 release (and in some cases even before that
release) so it is long past the time to remove them.  I also edited
the source tree files to remove all mentions of these functions (as well
as plParseOpts, plHLS_RGB, plRGB_HLS, and plarrows that had
been previously removed).  As a result

find . -type f |grep -v .git |xargs grep -E 'plParseInternalOpts|plSetInternalOpt|plclr|plpage|plcol|plcontf|plP_gvpd|plP_gvpw|plotsh3d|plSetOpt|plrgb|plrgb1|plhls|plwid' |grep -vE 'plcol0|plcol1|plcolorbar' |less

and

find . -type f |grep -v .git |xargs grep -E 'plParseOpts|plHLS_RGB|plRGB_HLS|plarrows' |less

now only find non-relevant hits or else hits for historical references
(e.g., change logs and release notes) to these functions.

1.7 Official deprecation of plshade1

The implementation of plStatic2dGrid (see 2.4) has made
the C routine plshade1 and its C++ wrapper pls->shade1 redundant.
Therefore, plshade1 and its C++ wrapper have now been officially
deprecated, i.e., only available if the CMake option -DPL_DEPRECATED=ON
is used.

1.8 Official deprecation of C++ cruft

The following C++ methods have been unoffically deprecated (via comments in the
code and lack of use in our C++ examples) for a long time:

// Previous function was inadvertently named plcol in old versions of
// plplot - this is maintained for backwards compatibility, but is best
// avoided in new code.  Use col1 method instead.
    void col( PLFLT c );
// Deprecated versions of methods which use PLINT instead of bool for logical arguments.
    void svect( const PLFLT *arrow_x, const PLFLT *arrow_y, PLINT npts, PLINT fill );
    void cpstrm( plstream &pls, PLINT flags );
    void plot3d( const PLFLT *x, const PLFLT *y, const PLFLT * const *z,
                 PLINT nx, PLINT ny, PLINT opt, PLINT side );
    void poly3( PLINT n, const PLFLT *x, const PLFLT *y, const PLFLT *z, const PLINT *draw, PLINT ifcc );
    void scmap1l( PLINT itype, PLINT npts, const PLFLT *intensity,
                  const PLFLT *coord1, const PLFLT *coord2, const PLFLT *coord3, const PLINT *alt_hue_path );

    void shade( const PLFLT * const *a, PLINT nx, PLINT ny,
                PLDEFINED_callback defined,
                PLFLT left, PLFLT right, PLFLT bottom, PLFLT top,
                PLFLT shade_min, PLFLT shade_max,
                PLINT sh_cmap, PLFLT sh_color, PLFLT sh_width,
                PLINT min_color, PLFLT min_width,
                PLINT max_color, PLFLT max_width,
                PLFILL_callback fill, PLINT rectangular,
                PLTRANSFORM_callback pltr, PLPointer pltr_data );

    void shades( const PLFLT * const *a, PLINT nx, PLINT ny, PLDEFINED_callback defined,
                 PLFLT xmin, PLFLT xmax, PLFLT ymin, PLFLT ymax,
                 const PLFLT * clevel, PLINT nlevel, PLFLT fill_width,
                 PLINT cont_color, PLFLT cont_width,
                 PLFILL_callback fill, PLINT rectangular,
                 PLTRANSFORM_callback pltr, PLPointer pltr_data );

    void shade( Contourable_Data& d, PLFLT xmin, PLFLT xmax,
                PLFLT ymin, PLFLT ymax, PLFLT shade_min, PLFLT shade_max,
                PLINT sh_cmap, PLFLT sh_color, PLFLT sh_width,
                PLINT min_color, PLFLT min_width,
                PLINT max_color, PLFLT max_width,
                PLINT rectangular,
                Coord_Xformer *pcxf );

    void fshade( PLFLT ( *f2eval )( PLINT, PLINT, PLPointer ),
                 PLPointer f2eval_data,
                 PLFLT ( *c2eval )( PLINT, PLINT, PLPointer ),
                 PLPointer c2eval_data,
                 PLINT nx, PLINT ny,
                 PLFLT left, PLFLT right, PLFLT bottom, PLFLT top,
                 PLFLT shade_min, PLFLT shade_max,
                 PLINT sh_cmap, PLFLT sh_color, PLFLT sh_width,
                 PLINT min_color, PLFLT min_width,
                 PLINT max_color, PLFLT max_width,
                 PLFILL_callback fill, PLINT rectangular,
                 PLTRANSFORM_callback pltr, PLPointer pltr_data );

    void spause( PLINT pause );

    void stripc( PLINT *id, const char *xspec, const char *yspec,
                 PLFLT xmin, PLFLT xmax, PLFLT xjump, PLFLT ymin, PLFLT ymax,
                 PLFLT xlpos, PLFLT ylpos,
                 PLINT y_ascl, PLINT acc,
                 PLINT colbox, PLINT collab,
                 const PLINT colline[], const PLINT styline[], const char *legline[],
                 const char *labx, const char *laby, const char *labtop );

    void xormod( PLINT mode, PLINT *status );

The above methods have now been officially deprecated, i.e., they will only
be accessible if a user sets -DPL_DEPRECATED=ON.

1.9 plplot.org and www.plplot.org are now our official domains

We have gone through the 3 steps in https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/Custom%20VHOSTs/
(see also ??? www/README.domain) so that plplot.org and www.plplot.org are our official
domains.

We have also gone through our source tree and replaced all instances
of plplot.sf.net and plplot.sourceforge.net with plplot.org.  As a
result the website that is generated and uploaded by this release will
use the official plplot.org domain for all internal references.  And
we have changed our official domain at sf.net/projects/plplot to
plplot.org as well.  We encourage all PLplot users to use that
official PLplot domain as well.

2. Improvements relative to the previous release

2.1 Bug fixes

The bug fixes in this release are noted in the roughly 100 ??? commit messages
collected in ChangeLog.release.

2.2 Update control of Python version

The build system now takes the following steps to search for a suitable
Python version.

* The build system searches for the PLPLOT_PYTHON_EXACT_VERSION version
  of Python where PLPLOT_PYTHON_EXACT_VERSION is specified by the
  user.  If this string is not specified by the user it defaults to
  "", and this exact search therefore always fails in this case.

* If that first exact search is a failure and the option FORCE_PYTHON2
  is not ON, the build system searches for PYTHON 3.

* If neither of the above two searches is a success, then the build
  system searches for Python 2.

2.3 Rewrite the build-system logic for determining PYQT_SIP_DIR and PYQT_SIP_FLAGS

For pyqt4 the pyqtconfig module useful for determining PYQT_SIP_DIR
and PYQT_SIP_FLAGS has been deprecated and has therefore already
completely disappeared from some software platforms (e.g.,
MinGW-w64/MSYS2).  Therefore, in this release we have replaced that
approach with an approach very similar to what we currently use for
pyqt5 (where the pyqtconfig module has never been available).

For both the pyqt4 and pyqt5 cases, PYQT_SIP_FLAGS is straightforward
to determine but determination of PYQT_SIP_DIR, the location where the
PyQT sip files are located, is not completely straightforward.  For
Linux, Cygwin, and MinGW-w64/MSYS2, we feel we have the correct HINTS
in place to find this directory for either the pyqt4 or pyqt5 cases,
but for other platforms users can specify the correct PYQT_SIP_DIR
directly and are invited to communicate that information to us so we
can update our HINTS appropriately.

2.4 Implementation of plStatic2dGrid

The 2D matrix arguments of plshade, plshades, plcont, plimage, plvect,
etc., for our C API and corresponding C++ API must currently be
organized as Iliffe column vectors (see
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliffe_vector>) containing pointers to
PLFLT row vectors.  And these matrices are normally in the C case
dynamically allocated with plAlloc2dGrid and freed with plFree2dGrid,
and in the C++ case the same thing is done with C++ wrappers for
plAlloc2dGrid and plFree2dGrid.  However, that dynamically allocated
approach does not allow our C and C++ users to call plshade, etc.,
with statically allocated 2D matrices.

Historically we have partially addressed that issue by implementing a
plshade1 variant of plshade that could be called with a statically
allocated 2D matrix.  Expanding that approach with plshades1, plcont1,
etc., variants is possible, but does considerably clutter our C and
C++ API.  So instead for this release we have implemented the
plStatic2dGrid C function and associated C++ wrapper which allows C
and C++ users to determine the Iliffe column vector corresponding to a
2D statically allocated array. The examples/c/x15c.c and
examples/c++/x15.cc standard examples demonstrate how to use this new
approach to call plshade using 2D data that have been statically
allocated, and although none of our examples illustrate these
additional possibilities, this same approach could also be used to
call plshades, etc., with 2D data that have been statically allocated.
And since this new approach completely supersedes plshade1, we have
officially deprecated that function and its C++ wrapper, see 1.7.

2.5 Replace use of the deprecated WIN32 and __WIN32__ macros by the _WIN32 macro

In our C and C++ source code we now detect non-Cygwin Windows platforms
using the recommended _WIN32 macro (supported by all modern versions
of compilers that work on Windows platforms) rather than the deprecated
WIN32 and __WIN32__ macros.

2.6 Resolution of remaining PostScript differences

For PLplot-5.13.0 the PostScript difference report was perfect
except for the following long-standing OCaml
issues:

ocaml
  Missing examples            :
  Differing graphical output  :  16 19 33
  Missing stdout              :
  Differing stdout

Those OCaml inconsistencies with the other languages have now been
fixed by the following steps:

* Implement the plmap* API for our OCaml binding and implement the
  "Exmoor" page for examples/ocaml/x19.ml using that new API to
  achieve consistency for this example.

* In examples/ocaml/x16.xml replace use of the high-level colorbar
  function (which set and restored color which interfered with
  consistency with the other languges) with plcolorbar to achieve
  consistency for this example.

* In examples/ocaml/x33.ml implement all pages concerning
  demonstrating the plcolorbar capability (page 5 onward) to achieve
  consistency for this example.

In sum, with these improvements we now have a perfect PostScript difference
report for the first time in 7 years, i.e.,

ocaml
  Missing examples            :
  Differing graphical output  :
  Missing stdout              :
  Differing stdout

and similarly for all the other computer languages we support.  Long
may this perfection continue....
