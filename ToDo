Areas currently under development
---------------------------------

o The manual needs BADLY to be updated.

o New color model.  Palette to consist of three parts: 1) Color map 0 --
fixed colors for plotting axes, lines, labels, whatever.  Maximum number
of colors is 16.  2) Color map 1 -- only referenced indirectly, through
"intensity" levels.  For mapping function values to color levels, through
a user-specified mapping (default mapping given in HLS coordinates;
eventually a nice input mechanism will be available for the Tcl/TK driver
at least).  3) Window manager colors.  Known only to driver.  For example,
if you have a color palette of 256 colors total, you might have 16 colors
in color map 0, leave the 8 or so colors the window manager is using
alone, leaving 232 colors for shading (pretty reasonable).  The idea is to
still get reasonable output even if you have far less colors to choose
from.  The preliminary work here is done but there's still a ways to go.

o Exercise Tcl/TK driver using (a) invocation from plserver by spawning a
background command, and (b) direct plotting to widgets.  Investigate using
Tcl-DP to send messages between the tk driver and plserver, since using
TK send over a network sucks (for other than local communication).

o Color fill support at the driver level, for devices that support it.
Incorporate at a high level in two ways: solid fills for use in plshade,
and a shading routine that uses all the available colors in color map 1.

o Fix all 2d array plotters to have similar syntax.  This includes the
contourers, mesh plots, and plshade.  Most general function in each
category should accept transformer function and transformer data, to work
with arbitrary data layouts.  So far this is only implemented in the
contouring routines.

o Give file familying a good workout, since it is most probably busted in
some respect or another.

o Need developers to adopt the DOS, OS/2 ports, since original developers
no longer use those systems.

o Still some bugs in the Amiga drivers.  Also looking for an individual
to adopt this port.




Things planned for sometime in the future.
----------------------------------------------

o CGM driver.  Shouldn't be too hard, just haven't gotten around to it yet.
Any volunteers?  Should I assume the presence of a CGM library?  Or should
I carry my own routines to do low-level operations to the CGM file?
(Here I could borrow from a freely distributable package that deals with
CGM files).

o graphical entities to be "objectized", so they are easier to manipulate
from plrender.  Likely candidates: plot, string, character, tick, axis, 
line, etc.

o Better use of driver intelligence, esp. for text -- the postscript driver
should be capable of using postscript fonts instead of the Hershey fonts.

o Explicit support for plotting points, lines in 3d space.

o Vector field plotter.

o The dashed line draws are incredibly slow and should be optimized.

o Cloned streams, for plotting to multiple devices simultaneously.

o Fully document the plplot-driver interface.
