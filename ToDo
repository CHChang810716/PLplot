Areas currently under development
---------------------------------

 - The manual needs BADLY to be updated.

 - Exercise Tcl/TK driver using direct widget control!

 - Install custom colormaps under X.  The current scheme will work even
   for multiple plplot apps, as long as there are enough colors for just
   one of the colormaps and the plplot apps use the same color schemes
   (because identical rgb color cells will be shared).  Either that, or
   the color allocations have to fail in exactly the same way (a stretch).
   The custom color maps that are eventually installed should copy colors
   in use by existing apps (such as the window manager) if reasonable
   in order to reduce flicker.  Not sure how to do that, though.

 - finish cmap1 dialog for TK driver

 - fix 2d function plotter API's: Most general function in each
   category should accept transformer function and transformer data, to work
   with arbitrary data layouts, but there should also be FE's for the
   "usual data types".  Work to be done:
	- add contour plotter FE's
	- add condition code array handler to plshade
	  (upgrade plAlloc.. to handle char variables?)
	- fix API for surface plotter
	- add vector field plot?
	- better document the 2d function plotter API in plfcont, etc.

 - Give file familying a good workout, since it is most probably busted in
   some respect or another.

 - See if ps output files work with up(1).

 - Various color drivers should be upgraded to work similar to the tek
   driver, with support for setting the color palette from the user
   program as well as cmap1.  I (Maurice) will probably only be supporting
   the tek, X, ps, and Amiga drivers in this regard, so contributions are
   welcomed.  The tek driver shows how to get the most out of a 16 color
   display.

 - Write plcfill() or whatever to cheaply fill 2d functions based
   on cell value only.  Should be faster than plshade for many grid
   points (e.g. 128**2).

 - The color map selection in the versaterm driver still doesn't work
   quite right.  When running x16c, the following happens:
	o one or more of the early fills is "lost"
	o using a black background, the background is not set (a bug?),
	  there is a red band where black should be, and the high end
	  goes to brown, not red.
	o with a white background (FFF), it looks almost OK, except for
	  the lost fill.

   The vlt driver almost always works fine, except when running under
   amuw, the first time you start up it may lose some of the initial color
   map select and a fill or more.  This almost never happens if the
   graphics screen is already up, which tells me it's a timing problem
   (the info is coming too fast).  But I don't know what to do about it.

 - implement some sort of raster-oriented output.  GIF might be good since
   it runs on lots of machines (originated with PC's but now supported
   under Unix and Amiga).  Any PD code for writing it from Unix?

 - support command line arg reading from Fortran under the big 4 if
   possible: HP, Sunos, Unicos, AIX.

 - metafile produced on the Amiga isn't quite right!  Compiler bug?

 - How can I modify the surface plotter to do color overlays?

 - Get x14c working, write x14f and x15f?

 - add more utility functions to make example programs easier to write?  

 - start using m4 to preprocess the Fortran demos?

 - Fix DP driver as needed, especially from Crays

 - figure out why plrender is barfing on my old metafiles under ~/data

 - find bug in contour plotter?  (spurious; unfortunately I didn't
   keep the data that caused it -- from Monte-4 run)

 - add support for shared libs on SunOS, AIX

 - check out shared library support under SAS/C -- supposed to be easy
   (6.0 and later)

 - Put Tcl/TK shared lib build fixes for AIX, HPUX in shared lib package.

 - Build TKNX and get it to work with Tcl-DP driver?

 - put pen width option in TK driver

 - const'ify plplot API

 - Switch to vfork() for TK driver on Cray.

 - Option in TK driver to preserve aspect ratio during zooms.

 - fix bugs in Amiga print driver.

 - mouse dragging in TK driver text window should cause a scroll.

 - get plplot up under gcc on the Amiga?




Things planned for sometime in the future.
----------------------------------------------

o CGM driver.  Shouldn't be too hard, just haven't gotten around to it yet.
Any volunteers?  Should I assume the presence of a CGM library?  Or should
I carry my own routines to do low-level operations to the CGM file?
(Here I could borrow from a freely distributable package that deals with
CGM files).

o graphical entities to be "objectized", so they are easier to manipulate
from plrender.  Likely candidates: plot, string, character, tick, axis, 
line, etc.

o Better use of driver intelligence, esp. for text -- the postscript driver
should be capable of using postscript fonts instead of the Hershey fonts.

o Explicit support for plotting points, lines in 3d space.

o Cloned streams, for plotting to multiple devices simultaneously.

o Fully document the plplot-driver interface.

o Japanese plplot/TK extensions?

o Japanese font extensions?

o Need developers to adopt the DOS, OS/2 ports, since original developers
no longer use those systems.  Also looking for an individual to adopt this
port.
