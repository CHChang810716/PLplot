Areas currently under development
---------------------------------

o The manual needs to be updated.

o Amiga drivers still being revamped.

o Fix the bug that causes no labels in y to appear on a log plot when the min
and max are both within the same decade.


These may make it into 5.0, but it's too early to tell for sure:

o New color model.  Palette to consist of three parts: 1) Color map 0 --
fixed colors for plotting axes, lines, labels, whatever.  Maximum number
of colors is 16.  2) Color map 1 -- only referenced indirectly, through
"intensity" levels.  For mapping function values to color levels, through
a user-specified mapping (default mapping given in HLS coordinates;
eventually a nice input mechanism will be available under X-windows, Amiga,
perhaps other platforms).  3) Window manager colors.  Known only to driver.
The preliminary work here is done but there's still a ways to go.

o GUI driver under X, complete with menus.  Originally a Motif driver
developed (now broken!) as an exercise.  Am leaning to using TCL/TK (freely
distributable) to use in final driver.

o Color fill contour plots.  Have an algorithm worked out but no code written
yet.

o CGM driver.  Shouldn't be too hard, just haven't gotten around to it yet.
Any volunteers?


Things that may make it into future revisions.
----------------------------------------------

o graphical entities to be "objectized", so they are easier to manipulate
from plrender.  Likely candidates: plot, string, character, tick, axis, 
line, etc.

o Better use of driver intelligence, esp. for text -- the postscript driver
should be capable of using postscript fonts instead of the Hershey fonts.

o Explicit support for plotting points, lines in 3d space.

o Vector field plotter.
