Commit from rlaboiss (2004-02-14 13:38 CET)
--------------------

Changed order of build and install tree binary directories, such that make
check picks the pltcl in the build tree even when the package is installed
in the system.  Also, changed @prefix@ to @exec_prefix@, because this is the
true prefix for /bin (as defined by configure).

tek4010, tek4010f, tek4107, tek4107f, versaterm, vlt, and xterm devices by
default because unmaintained (ntk) or "old".  xterm made the list because
from conex to vlt fails to disappear unless xterm is gone as well.
Furthermore, xterm is pretty lame (monochrome, software fill) so you would
probably only want to enable it if nothing else worked.

Commit from rlaboiss (2004-02-13 16:17 CET)
--------------------

Instead of setting PYTHONPATH in test/test_python.sh.in, prior to the call
to pythondemos.py, use sys.path.insert three times in
examples/python/plplot_python_start.py.in, taking care of putting the build
tree directories before the install tree one.

This guarantees no interferences between the build and install trees, as
regards the Pyhton tests done by plplot-test.sh.

Commit from rlaboiss (2004-02-13 14:17 CET)
--------------------

Added a catch argument to the eval call, such that the loop iterating over
the demo scripts is not interrupted if one of them fails.  Also, the names
of the failing scripts are shown at end of execution of the test program,
e.g.:

    Failed tests: x01o.m, x03o.m

Furthermore, when there are failures, the test script must return an error
status (hence the "exit(1)" at the end), such that "make check" can
correctly report failures.

I similar approach should be implemented in pythondemos.py, but I have to
learn more Python before doing it (or perhaps Alan should do it?)

Commit from rlaboiss (2004-02-12 17:40 CET)
--------------------

Make the python test in test_python.sh really work from anywhere, such that
"make check" works, even if PLplot is not installed in the system.  This
completes my work in this area.  From the tarball tree, one just have to do
now:

    ./configure ; make check

to build the whole thing and test it.

From a fresh CVS checked out tree:

    ./bootstrap.sh ; ./configure ; make check

I simply added components to PYTHONPATH in test_python.sh, such that Python
can find the plplot modules.  However, I do not understand why "import
_plplotc" does not work when _plplotcmodule.so is not installed in the
Python site-packages directory in the system.  For that reason, a check_DATA
variable was introduced in bindings/python/Makefile.am, such that copies of
the modules with the correct names are created in bindings/python/.libs
(similarly to what is done in install-exec-hook, but also strip "module"
from the file names.)

--------------------

Further efforts to have "make check" working from the build tree, without
needing to install PLplot in the sytem.

The test_tcl.sh problem was easy to fix.  I just remove all instances the
variable installbindir, which was set in plplot-test.sh and used in
test_tcl.sh.  The PATH variable is used instead.

The Python demos still do not work, although the setting of PYTHONPATH in
test_python.sh.  I will investigate this later.

The environment variable EXAMPLES_DIR passed to plplot-test.sh throught eht
varaible TESTS_ENVIRONMENTS in Makefile.am is now absolute.

--------------------

"make check" will now run the plplot-test.sh script in the build tree.  This
is extremely useful, since developers have just to type "./configure ; make
check" to have everything built and tested after a fresh cvs checkout.  This
is what we have now (some uninteresting lines were removed):

    $ cd test
    $ make check
    make  check-TESTS
    Testing front-end c
    Testing front-end cxx
    Testing front-end f77
    Testing front-end octave
    Testing front-end python
    Testing front-end tcl
    PASS: plplot-test.sh
    ==================
    All 1 tests passed
    ==================

Of course, the final message "All 1 tests passed" means only that there was
no execution errors in the examples programs.  This can be improved in the
future by comparing the results with some pre-built information, like the
md5sum of the resulting files included somewhere in the distribution
tarball.  This is a long-term goal.

The changes in test/Makefile.am are trivial, just including the definitions
of the variables TESTS and TESTS_ENVIRONMENT.  This later variable allows
environment variables to be passed to the plplot-test.sh script.

For having all this working, but keeping all the previous functionalities of
plplot-test.sh, I had to make a lot of changes in the script.  Two good
news: (1) no changes were needed to the test_*.sh scripts and (2) although
plplot-test.sh is highly improved, its size reduced by 40 lines! (I love so
much to remove cruft and avoid useless repetition of code... have I told you
that already? :-)

Here is the detail of the changes to plplot-test.sh:

  * The script can be launched from any place now.  This was impossible
    before, because the test_*.sh files where launched like "./test_c.sh".
    The path for the test_*.sh scripts is deduced from the path of $0.

  * The script takes into account now four environment variables, namely
    DEVICE, FRONT_END, OUTPUT_DIR, and EXAMPLES_DIR, which mimic the options
    --device, --front-end, --output-dir, and --examples-dir, respectively,
    but are overridden by them.

  * OUTPUT_DIR specifies the directory in which the resulting files are
    stored (defaults to ".") and EXAMPLES_DIR where the examples are
    (defaults also to ".").  If a subdirectory "c/" is not found under
    EXAMPLES_DIR, the script aborts with an error message.

  * The script works from the build tree now.  The only change to make that
    work was the addition of "$EXAMPLES_DIR/../bindings/octave//" to the
    octavedir variable.

  * The FRONT_END environment variable, as well as the --front-end option
    accept now a list of front-ends to test, like this --front-end="c f77".

  * In order to have "make check" working properly, the plplot-test.sh
    script must return a useful status value.  It loops then over the set of
    specified fornt ends and, if any one them failed, then 1 returned.
    Otherwise, a status value of 0 is returned.

  * I have used my own Bourne shell programming style, i.e. instead of
    writing:

        foo=1
	export foo
	bar=2
	export bar

    I use the more compact:

        export foo=1 bar=2

    Also, instead of:

        if test this = that ; then
	    do-it
	fi

    we have now:

        test this = that && do-it

    Join the campaign: "Better style for concise (albeit unobfuscated) code".

Commit from rlaboiss (2004-02-10 18:36 CET)
--------------------

The two plplotcapi.i files which used to be in bindings/java and
bindings/python and shared a extensive amount of code are now centralized in
bindings/swig-support/plplotcapi.i.  The java- and python-specific sections
of this former file are conditionally included by CPP macros:

    #ifdef SWIG_JAVA
    #ifdef SWIG_PYTHON

When calling swig in bindings/{java,python}/Makefile.am, the right -DSWIG_*
option is used now.  New variables have been created in these Makefile.am's,
namely SWIG_SUPPORT_DIR, PLPLOTCAPI_I, and SWIG_CMD.  This later one is
particularly useful in the Python case, since it avoids "useless repetition
of code" (a.k.a "things that hurt eyes" :-)

The directory bindings/swig-support/ is included in the tarball through the
variable EXTRA_DIST in bindings/Makefile.am.

These changes are fully tested for Python, but no tests were done for Java.
I may also have messed with some comments in the plplotcapi.i file.  Please,
review it.

Now that we have a centralized *.i file, the door is open for the other
scripting languages supported by Swig: PHP, Ruby, Guile, Mzscheme, Chicken,
Ocaml, Pike, and C# (!).

Initial commit of real (i.e. non-placeholder) 14th java example.

Results are not quite the same as the 14th example for other language
interfaces.

* There is one minor rendering issue; some of the postscript position values
  are off by one unit (presumably due to 16-bit character rendering), but
  this makes no visible difference.

* There is an API issue; pls.plgdev does not work because haven't yet
  figured out how to export C strings into a java environment using swig
  typemaps.  Thus, plgdev and plsdev are commented out and must set second
  device by hand using plinit menu.

plplot-test.sh, (and test_python.sh) permissions in the build tree are
probably irrelevant.  The former requires plplot-libtool which must be in
the PATH, but that automatically puts the installed version of plplot-config
in the PATH as well.  Some developer debugging plplot-config is free to
change the build tree version permission to execute, but that is a pretty
special case.  plplot-test.sh is really only designed to work from
the installed examples tree (or copy thereof).  So it is probably good that
its build tree permissions are not executable.

Move xw14.py and xw17.py from examples_python_DATA to examples_python_SCRIPTS
since they are now standalone and therefore should have execute permission
when installed.

Drop extraneous semi-colons that don't belong in the code

  plplot  examples/python/xw09.py  1.25


Commit from airwin (2004-02-07 02:10 CET)
------------------

Make this example standalone since it only works for interactive devices.
Note there is a fairly hard landing with many error messages if you use
non-interactive devices because plsError (to register your own local error
return code and error message locations) is not part of the Python API (and
not likely to be any time soon since as far as I know it is a hard problem
to do something like this in python.)

  plplot  examples/python/xw17.py  1.11


Commit from airwin (2004-02-07 02:03 CET)
------------------

Softer landing (like C example) if non-interactive device is used in error.

Generalize char* OUTPUT typemap so that it can be one of a number of

work for other reasons.

Improved this script, such that the upload to the web site is done
automatically.  Notice that the demo files should now go into
htdocs/examples-data.

The fresh build at the beginning can be controlled by the environment
variable "build".

Also, fixes a shell syntax in if conditional.

Commit from airwin (2004-02-06 06:59 CET)
------------------

Tighten configure check and run-time check for case when iargc
inappropriately returns a negative number of arguments. (iargc() returned -1
once for a badly linked libplplotf77 due to FLIBS problems on Cygwin.
Hopefully, bad linking of libplplotf77 won't happen again, but it is better
to be safe than sorry.)

  plplot  configure.ac                    1.160
  plplot  bindings/f77/configurable.f.in  1.5


Commit from airwin (2004-02-06 02:21 CET)
------------------

Remove all reference to commented out AC_F77_LIBRARY_LDFLAGS.  This macro
should never ever be required again since we no longer have mixed fortran
and C source libraries to contend with.

Also change version and release date corresponding to post-5.3.0.

  plplot  configure.ac  1.159


Commit from airwin (2004-02-06 02:17 CET)
------------------

As discussed on list (some time ago), split libplplotf77.  Now there is a
pure fortran source library (still called libplplotf77) which wraps a pure C
source library (libplplotf77c) which in turn wraps libplplot.  Thus, we now
have two pure-source libraries defining the fortran interface to PLplot that
are linked by respectively the F77 command and the CC command.  These
linking tasks for pure source libraries are straightforward for libtool on
all platforms it supports.

This change means an end to worrying about using FLIBS to specify how to
link a library with combined fortran and C source code.  FLIBS is poorly
known for many combinations of fortran compilers, C compilers, and linkers
so this change should remove a major cross-platform headache.
