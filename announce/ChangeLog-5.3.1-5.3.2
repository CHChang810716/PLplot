Move plplot.jar to $prefix/java and plplotjavac_wrap.so to $prefix/lib/jni.
We now follow Debian recommendations on this for want of any clearer guidance.

Whoops. Missed one reference when changing the Plplot class name to PLplot.

  plplot  bindings/java/Makefile.am  1.35


Commit from andrewross (2004-07-05 12:07 CEST)
----------------------

Rename Plplot class to PLplot - consistent with our project name. It is
customary to capitalise the name of java classes, hence PLplot rather than
plplot.

Change close() method back to use end1 / end instead since this is slightly
more flexible where you want to open and close streams without having to
reinitialise the library.

Update examples to reflect these changes.

Commit from andrewross (2004-07-02 17:58 CEST)
----------------------

Add the following missing functions to the C++ bindings. The C++ bindings
now contain all the functions in the java/python bindings, plus a few extra
which haven't been implemented with swig yet.

  plplot  bindings/c++/plstream.cc  1.28
  plplot  bindings/c++/plstream.h   1.21


Commit from andrewross (2004-07-02 17:22 CEST)
----------------------

Add a new Plplot java class. This effectively wraps the plplotjavac class
in an object orientated manner, rather like the C++ plstream class. Each
instance of a class is associated with a plplot stream. Loading of the
java library and switching streams is handled automatically. This is
what was always intended for the java wrapper I believe, but never
happened with swig.

Update examples to use the new Plplot class. This removes most of the
warning messages generated by jikes. A few remain because the new class
implements the plplotjavacConstants interface to get the constant PL_*.

Since this is built on top of the existing bindings it is completely
backwards compatible. To add new functions you need to add them to
Plplot.java as well as to plplotcapi.i (in the swig directory).

Commit from andrewross (2004-07-01 11:15 CEST)
----------------------

More refinements of the java build process. The java class files for the
bindings and examples are now compiled separately in their own subdirectories
at compile time. The created class files, along with the README files and
the java example code is installed at install time. An installation hook
then creates a single jar file plplot.jar from the plplot/ class tree in
share/plplot/java/ and removes the tree.

The examples can now be run after installation by doing something like
java -classpath /usr/local/share/plplot-5.3.1/java/plplot.jar plplot.examples.x01
or by setting the CLASSPATH variable and doing
java plplot.examples.x01

Note the examples are also installed along with a makefile to build them in
share/plplot/examples/java since that is where the user might expect to
find them. If you ensure the examples directory is before the plplot.jar
file in your classpath then it should pick up the correct version of the
examples in case the user wants to edit and test them.

export CLASSPATH=/usr/local/share/plplot-5.3.1/examples/java:/usr/local/share/plplot-5.3.1/java/plplot.jar

Commit from aroach (2004-07-01 07:11 CEST)
------------------

The last addition to this driver was two registary keys to provide
"default" setup with respect to freetype (I was getting sick of
always using -drvopt text,smooth). Well, that was great, but I
neglected to have a mechanism for SETTING these registary keys,
meaning you would have to set them using regedit. To overcome this,
I have added a new command line -drvopt "save", which will save the
current settings to the registary. For example, "-drvopt
text=0,smooth=0,save" will set the registary keys to use the hershey
fonts and no smoothing by default (ie if no -drvopt is given), whereas
"-drvopt text,smooth,save" will SET freetype text support with smoothing
ON by default for any time nothing contridictory is supplied on the
command line using -drvopt.

Commit from andrewross (2004-06-30 18:04 CEST)
----------------------

Changes to configuration, build and test process for java to enable
"make check" to work with java examples. Java examples can now be built
in situ. Tested with jikes/sablevm and with the Sun JDK.

The environment variable JAVACFLAGS is now honoured for building the java
examples. An immediate use of this is to add the -nowarn flag for jikes
which otherwise generates lots of (slightly) spurious warning messages.
Alan and I are working on it...

Commit from aroach (2004-06-30 15:13 CEST)
------------------

Made some subtle changes to get rid of a couple of -pedantic
warnings.
Also added two registry entries for the driver that "double up" on
the driver options. the keys are:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\PLplot\wingcc\freetype
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\PLplot\wingcc\smooth
If either of these are set to 1, then that feature will, by default, be
activated. so setiing both keys to 1 in the registry it is the same as
-drvopt text,smooth

Compile java files in the build tree, create jar files, then install jar
files. Just like we do for other languages.

There are two separate jar files so the user can play with and rebuild the
examples if they like. There is a Makefile in share/plplot/examples/java
for this - like the Makefile.examples for other languages.

Update test_java.sh script to use the new jar files. As long as everything
is in the installation directories set at configure time there is no need
to set the CLASSPATH.

Tested with gcj and with Sun JDK. Please check this on your system,
particularly if you are not using Linux.

can add something like

to you java command. Should help make code more relocatable and also help
with getting "make check" to work in the build tree.
