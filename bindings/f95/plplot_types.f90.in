! Parameters for identifying the kind of PLplot's real
! numbers (a configuration parameter)
! Use whatever name suits you better.

module plplot_flt
  ! Control the kind of floating point number
  ! used by PLplot (single vs double)
  ! This file is automatically configured by CMake
  integer, parameter :: plflt   = kind(@ONE_IN_DEFAULT_PRECISION@)
  ! The idea here is to match the Fortran 4-byte integer with
  ! the corresponding C types for PLINT (normally int32_t) and
  ! PLUNICODE (normally uint32_t).  According to websites I have
  ! read, Fortran has no unsigned integer types and 
  ! using 4 here is much safer than anything more complicated.
  integer, parameter :: plint  = 4
  integer, parameter :: plunicode  = 4
end module
