These notes are from the stand-alone version of the ocaml bindings and 
are retained only for interest.

This is an interface to PLplot (http://plplot.sourceforge.net/) for the
Objective Caml language.

* REQUIREMENTS
- PLplot >5.9.0
- OCaml 3.10.x
  - ocamlbuild is used to compile ocaml-plplot.  ocamlbuild is only included
    in OCaml 3.10.0 and later.  No other 3.10.x specific OCaml functionality
    is used in ocaml-plplot.
- camlidl
- findlib
- GNU make

* INSTALLATION
Modify INCDIRS and LIBDIRS in the Makefile to point to your PLplot installation
$ make            (generates bytecode and native libs, plus a toplevel)
$ make libinstall (to install the library using findlib)

* NOTES
ocaml-plplot has only been tested on OCaml 3.10.x, under 32bit Linux (Fedora,
Debian and CentOS).  It should work on a 64bit system as well as older versions
of OCaml, but these are not tested.  Any feedback regarding function or lack of
function on other platforms is welcome.

This wrapper/interface is still in a fairly basic state.  Most of the 2D and 3D
plotting routines are in place.  For a 3D plotting example, see the file
examples/x11.ml - a direct port of the PLplot example 11.  The function names
are the same as for the PLplot C API.  Function parameters are largely the
same, with the exception that most arguments indicating array lengths are
deduced automatically by the camlidl generated interface (the "redacted form"
of the commands in the PLplot manual).

The best reference is currently the PLplot web page shown at the top of this
README file.  The documentation there for the C API holds for the most part here
as well.
