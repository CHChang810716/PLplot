Install:

plplot_octave.h is the main important file. It is a massaged version
of plplot's plplot.h file, ready for use with Holt's matwrap, which
you can find at

	http://lnc.usc.edu/~holt/matwrap/

As usual, you should get the last version, 0.57 at the time of this
writing. You also need perl.

You must compile PLplot with shared libraries, which 'configure' does
by default if your OS is supported.

What you get:

You have a 'demo' directory, with the equivalent octave script files
x??c.m of PLplot C demos, and some new demos, p??.m.

You have a 'PLplot' directory with modified versions of the standard
octave plot command, plus a lot of new ones ready for Octave use. You
must have it on your LOADPATH before the standard octave/gnuplot plot
scripts. If you install it in the default directory, use the octave
command `octave_plplot_path' to setup the path. You can change between
the default gnuplot plotter and octave_plplot using the octave command
`use_plplot'.

You have a misc directory with some other octave demos/utilities.

You have an etc directory where the "documentation" is.

You have the directory where the LICENCE, README, INSTALL, PROBLEMS,
BUGS, ToDo, are, plus 'plplot.h', 'plplot_octave.cc', 'plplot_stub.m',
massage.c, etc.

Testing:

Before installing, you can test plplot_octave:

'cd' to directory plplot/tmp.

If you have another version of plplot installed, check, after invoking
octave and making same plots, the plplot version, typing "plgver'" (note
the apostrophe in plgver, meaning transpose). You should get the same
version that you have just compiled, not the installed version.

Invoke octave, and set the LOADPATH, typing
	LOADPATH="../bindings/octave//::"

There are several Octave demos, 'p1' up to 'p20'. Try them:

octave> for i=[1:15 19:20]; feval(sprintf("p%d",i));kbhit;endfor;oneplot

and a set of script files that emulate the well known x??c plplot demos. Try:

octave> plplot_octave_demo

# demo x14c might fail, if you have problems with tk.

You can set some preferences in the file 'pldef.m'

The default path to instalation is $prefix/share/plplot_octave. You must
set your LOADPATH to include it *before* the standard Octave LOADPATH.

If you just want to use the PLplot API, use it as you would from a C
program, with the exception that you don't need to specify matrices
dimensions; e.g., for plline(n,x,y) you just need to call it as
plline(x,y), where x and y are column vectors. Look at the various
x??x.m examples in the demos directory.

You can't call API functions whose arguments are pointers to
functions. Some wrappers for common situations are however available.

As with every program, except D. Knuth ones, the programs in this
package are not finished nor bug free. Please report bugs and send
patches. I will not send checks for each bug discovered :-)

Enjoy,

Joao
