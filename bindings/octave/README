This package enables you to use PLplot from within Octave.

You have two advantages:

	1 - Use a superior plotting package, having access to dozens
		of plotting commands, enabling you to customize your plots
		at your will,

	2 - Still use the same plot commands that you are familiarized,
		if you really want to.

	3 - Have some new and long waited ploting command scripts.

PLplot also has its disadvantages:

	It is not beeing actively maintained, and you must use the last
snapshot available, plplot-5.0. This is a kind of walking in a sharp
knife, but in my experience I found it bug free.

	If you build the Tcl/Tk driver, optional, you have a menu driven
way to plot to a file, choose the output device, zoom, pan, change
colors, etc.

Besides having acess to all PLplot API commands, and all Octave usual
commands, some with some improvements, new commands are available.
	Read the INSTALL file to continue.
