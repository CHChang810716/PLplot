  plpage()

  plpage

  Begins a new page. For a file driver, the output file is opened if
  necessary. Advancing the page via plclr and plpage is useful when a page
  break is desired at a particular point when plotting to subpages. Another
  use for plclr and plpage is when plotting pages to different files, since
  you can manually set the file name (or file handle) by calling plsfnam or
  plsfile after the call to plclr (in fact some drivers may only support a
  single page per file, making this a necessity). One way to handle this case
  automatically is to page advance via pladv, but enable familying (see
  plsfam) with a small byte per file limit so that a new family member file
  will be created on each page break.

  Except for one of these circumstances, it is best to advance the page or
  subpage simply by the call pladv(0).
