  plsori

  Sets the current orientation. If ori is equal to zero (default) then
  landscape is used (x axis is parallel to the longest edge of the page),
  otherwise portrait is used. This option is not supported by all output
  drivers (in particular, most interactive screen drivers ignore the
  orientation). This routine, if used, must be called before initializing
  PLplot.

  ori (PLINT, input): Orientation value.
