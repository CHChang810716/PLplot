  plsxax(digmax, digits)
  **********************

  plsxax

  Returns current values of the digmax and digits flags for the x axis.
  digits is updated after the plot is drawn, so so this routine should only
  be called _a_f_t_e_r the call to plbox (or plbox3) is complete. Annotation for
  more information.

  digmax (PLINT, output): Variable to set the maximum number of digits. If
  nonzero, the printed label will be switched to a floating point
  representation when the number of digits exceeds digmax.

  digits (PLINT, input): Field digits value. Currently, changing its value
  here has no effect since it is set only by plbox or plbox3. However, the
  user may obtain its value after a call to plbox by calling plgxax.
