This is still highly experimental.  To compile the Perl5 bindings for
PLplot, you will need swig, pdl, and the Perl modules XML::Parser and XML::DOM.
The API chapter of the Docbook documentation is parsed for generating the
function prototypes.

The build process has not yet been integrated into the PLplot package
configuration scheme.  For now, this is the cookbook:

    $ cd bindings/perl5
    $ make -f pkg_perl5.in ln-tmp
    $ cd ../../tmp
    $ make -f pkg_perl5.in 

[ Just ignore the warning messages about not found libraries and arguments
  in LIBS, when "perl Makefile.PL" is run.  They are harmless. ]

Then run the x01 demo:

    $ ./x01.pl
