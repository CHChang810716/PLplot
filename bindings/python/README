Subject: PLplot Python module
Status: RO

A while ago I told you that I'd written a Python interface to the
PLplot library.  I sent it to Guido van Rossum, but he doesn't plan to
include it in the next release of Python.  So I went to the trouble of
modifying the PLplot cf/*.in files to let the PLplot Makefile build
the dynamically loaded Python module and install it where Python will
find it.  I'm sending you the sources in a gzipped shar archive.  Pipe
this message through unshar to extract a tar file called python.tar.
Unpack the tar file in an empty directory (*not* in the PLplot source
tree---it will overwrite files in the cf subdirectory if you do that)
to get all of the new and changed files.  Then you can merge the
changes I made to the changed files by comparing them to your files
with diff.  The new files you can just move into the source tree with
mv.  For your convenience, I've run diff on the changed files myself
and saved the output in one of the new files (called 'diff') so that
you can see what were my changes and not the changes that you made
yourself since 4p99i's release.

A little credit in the documentation is OK, but I don't want to
continue maintaining the Python interface.  I hope it will be useful
enough that you or somebody else'll want to take over its maintenance.
You can do whatever you want with it.
