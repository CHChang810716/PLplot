This directory contains 'TEA-complaint' configuration and makefiles
to compile Plplot as a set of extensions to Tcl.  'TEA' stands for
'Tcl Extension Architecture' and is the modern way to build extensions
for Tcl so that they can be easily recompiled on any Tcl platform.

Note that in the instructions below, the 'autoconf' step is optional, 
since we provide a correctly generated configure file.

Note the current configuration is crude (but direct) and independent of
ordinary plplot configuration (except for the plDevs.h and PlConfig.h files
generated by that configuration, see below).  Later the two configurations
will be merged, but for simplicity they are separate now.

(1) cd ../tcl-matrix and install that package according to the Readme.txt
there.  Note that it is important the install location there is the same
as the install location here.

(2) 
cd ../..
./configure
#this last step does all sorts of things, but the only thing relevant to us
is it creates plDevs.h and plConfig.h in ../../tmp.

(3) cd bindings/tcl-pltcl  #return back to this directory
edit ../../tmp/plDevs.h to make sure it does NOT include the tk
driver, the xwin driver or the tkwin driver.

----------------------

On windows (using cygwin --- see www.scriptics.com for more
instructions), the following sort of thing should suffice:

(in the bash shell):

% autoconf
% ../configure --with-tcl=//d/tcl-source/tcl8.3.1/win/Release
--with-tclinclude=//d/tcl-source/tcl8.3.1/generic
--prefix=//d/progra~1/tcl

% make
% make install

'with-tcl' is the location of tclConfig.sh (this requirement may be
lifted in a future version of TEA).
'with-tclinclude' is the location of tcl.h
'prefix' is the install location

You may also wish to add 'exec-prefix' for a platform specific
installation location (otherwise prefix/bin will be used).

----------------------

On Linux (Debian system with a user-defined install region right in
the plplot tree for testing purposes).
autoconf
./configure --with-tcl=/usr/lib \
--with-tclinclude=/usr/include/tcl8.2/generic \
--prefix=../testinstalldir
make
#the following is done as ordinary user since ../testinstalldir is in a normal
#user account directory tree
make install 

Testing
#cd to install location
cd ../testinstalldir/lib
setenv PL_LIBRARY `pwd`/plplot5.1
tclsh
% #this next is required because of non-standard install location
% #use full path name before testinstalldir
% lappend auto_path [pwd]
% package require Pltcl
5.1
% cd ../../../examples/tcl
% plinit
(answer various queries here, selecting '9' = plplot metafile driver
or 13 = postscript colour driver are good standard tests.)
% source tcldemos.tcl
% 1
% 2
etc....

----------------------

Not tested yet on other unices, but should probably work.
