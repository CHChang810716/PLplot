# Pull out all the bazillions of itcl::'s that I put in in the prior
# patch.  That was a total botch.  I had completely misdiagnosed the
# problem.  The real problem was that I didn't set up the Itcl/Itk
# interpretter correctly--or to be more precise, I didn't set it up the
# same way that itkwish does--so my prior solution of inserting itcl::
# all over the place was seriously misguided.  This patch reverts things
# to the sane state.

# Revision 1.3  1998/11/18  06:05:33  furnish
# Itcl 3.x has class in namespace itcl, and it must be so qualified at
# all times.  Guess JO had some problems with the Itcl namespace system,
# and I haven't yet unlearned everything that will need to be unleared
# in order to cope with JO's always-unique view of Itcl.
#
# Revision 1.2  1995/10/26  07:12:04  furnish
# Hacked in a very hacky hack which seems to bring back the plxframe
# menus.  Not much testing done yet though.
#
# Revision 1.1  1995/09/18  20:17:09  furnish
# New [incr Tk] reincarnations of the old versions.  Unfortunately,
# PLXWin doesn't work quite right.  All that crudy Tcl code which
# expects to be able to much with widgets all over the widget tree, will
# have to be fixed.
#
# Revision 1.7  1995/06/01  21:22:22  mjl
# Removed a lot of the miscellaneous init garbage, now handled by
# plw_setup_defaults.
#
# Revision 1.6  1995/05/06  17:08:13  mjl
# Shave and a haircut.
#
# Revision 1.5  1995/04/12  08:00:30  mjl
# Eliminated use of client variable and fixed plw_create_TopRow syntax.
#
# Revision 1.4  1995/03/23  21:07:21  mjl
# Fix to fix of key bindings.
#
# Revision 1.3  1995/03/23  20:46:09  mjl
# Fixed key bindings.
#
# Revision 1.2  1994/10/04  18:18:47  mjl
# Inserted initialization of zoom windows lists.  Gross, but it should
# work.
#
# Revision 1.1  1994/06/10  20:43:57  furnish
# New extended plframe itcl widget.
