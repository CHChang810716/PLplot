The files in this directory must be concatenated to make the correct
PLplot Makefile.in.  This is subsequently edited by the configure script
using "sed", to make system-dependent variable substitutions.  The order
of concatenation should be:

init.in		(initialization)
dist.in		(default target, core source and object file lists)
pkg_<name>.in	(optional packages, e.g. f77, tcl, tk support)
initlib.in	(library initialization)
lib_<type>.in	(library target)
exes.in		(utility program dependencies & targets)
demos.in	(demo program dependencies & targets)
install.in	(installation targets)
misc.in		(misc targets: so far only clean and depend)
objs.in		(object file dependencies, autogenerated)

To build Makedemo.in (standalone makefile for demo programs), the
following concatenation is used:

init.in		(initialization)
initdemo.in	(demo initialization)
demos.in	(demo program dependencies & targets)
miscdemo.in	(misc targets: so far only clean)

Note that only files beginning with "init" contain macros set by the
configure script.

The files plConfig.h.in and plDevs.h.in are processed by configure to
obtain the final plConfig.h and plDevs.h header files.  The former is
included by plplotP.h and is thus seen by all PLplot source files.  The
latter is included by all drivers and plcore.h.  On a non-Unix system,
plConfig.h and plDevs.h should be configured by hand and linked (or
copied) to the tmp directory as part of the build procedure.

Note that the operation of configure can be customized on a per-user
basis.  Just set up a file ~/config/cf_plplot.in that contains the shell
variables you wish to predefine.  This can be used to set frequently used
options (such as what devices to enable) as well as speed up the
configuration script.  The latter is done by setting the location of
various include files and libraries, which otherwise need to be found by
configure through a search process.  Here is an example cf_plplot.in file
that I use on my workstation:

# --*-sh-*---------------------------------------------------------------
#
# PLplot configure script default variables.
#
# Created from contents of config.status and read automatically by
# configure to set up initial variables and reduce running time.
#
# Note: the internal representation of the --with-<option> and
# --enable-<option> command line switches actually uses an underscore,
# e.g. with_<option> and enable_<option>.  Don't forget!
