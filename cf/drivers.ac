dnl Drivers

dnl ------------------------------------------------------------------------
dnl

dnl Including a driver in the below list includes it by default.
dnl Note that each driver should be treated separately even if
dnl they are in the same source code file.
dnl For example, the ps and psc drivers are defined in the ps.c source
dnl code file.

dnl N.B. This is ordered the same as the *driver pair* list below to help
dnl humans keep the associations straight, but this is not necessary.

dnl Note specifically which drivers are known to be loadable.  Eventually,
dnl hopefully, every driver will show up on this list.  However, we add them one
dnl at a time since each will have its own peculiarities in the build process
dnl (none missing at present).

dnl N.B. This is ordered the same as the *driver pair* list below to help
dnl humans keep the associations straight, but this is not necessary.

dnl We think of a "device" as the output medium.  Could be a machine
dnl style (Tektronix, X11), or a file format (Postscript).
dnl
dnl A "driver" is the PLplot code that produces the output on the
dnl medium.
dnl
dnl Some drivers support multiple devices.  But we we need to make sure
dnl we compile only the selected drivers.  That is, if a driver supports
dnl devices not selected, we don't want to compile it at all.  Or if it
dnl supports multiple selected devices, we only want to compile it
dnl once.  To support this, we build an association list between devices
dnl and drivers.  This will be inspected to build up the set of drivers
dnl to be compiled based on which devices are selected.

dnl Ordered alphabetically by second in each pair (the driver) for human
dnl consumption, but this is not necessary.
