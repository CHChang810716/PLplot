# Decause of the bindings to interpreted languages such as Python or Java,
# dynamically linked drivers need to be linked against libplplot:
# (AWI believes this is due to the python and java teams forgetting to
# OR in the RTLD_GLOBAL flag with their dlopen calls.  
# See http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/dl-libraries.html
# for documentation of that flag.  The purpose of that flag is to make 
# symbols of the dlopened library (e.g. libplplot) available to subsequently
# dlopened libraries (i.e., one of these dynamic drivers).
# To work around the problem here we make all drivers **except xwin, and
# tkwin (which libplplot already links to and which seems to make the
# symbols available for those drivers)** link to libplplot.  We also arrange
# the libplplot Makefile dependency appropriately in all cases.
# 
# to the real source of the trouble).
