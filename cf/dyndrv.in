# Rules for building the dynamic (loadable) driver modules.
#
# NOTE: We make make all drivers depend on "libs", to ensure that the
# libraries are actually built before we need to link against them.
# This is because without this dependency, SMP builds (make -j #) tend
# to start linking the drivers before the libs are actually built.
# Other executables handle this via dependency upon $(PLLIBS), but
# this isn't defined yet at the point where dyndrv.in is included in
# the makefile.  And dyndrv.in has to be included high to get
# DYNLOAD_STUFF defined.  This all should be sorted out more carefully
# eventually, but for now we just use this hacky dependence upon the
# explicit "libs:" target.
