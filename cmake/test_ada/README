The purpose of this complete project is to provide a simple Ada test case
consisting of an Ada executable calling a single routine in an Ada library
which prints out the classic "hello, world" phrase.  This complete project
includes a CMake-based build system and files for Ada language support
within CMake which will eventually become part of CMake itself.

To run the test

(1) create an _empty_ build directory and cd to it.
mkdir build_dir
cd build_dir

(2) configure project with cmake 

  option a (built library is static).

cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF path/to/this/source/directory >& cmake.out

  option b (built library is shared by default).

cmake path/to/this/source/directory >& cmake.out

(3) build library and executable that links to it
make >& make.out

(4) run test that should generate "hello, world" phrase.

src_executable/hello

(5, optional) Test with valgrind:

valgrind src_executable/hello >& valgrind.out

(6, optional) Test with ldd -r

ldd -r src_executable/hello >& ldd.out

In sum, this project provides a simple demonstration of how to use the
CMake Ada language support with Ada libraries that are either static
or shared. At the same time, this project tests the quality of CMake
Ada support for various user's platforms.  If any user is having
trouble with CMake Ada language support, this is the simple test case
they should run (once for the shared case and once for the static
case) to help diagnose the problem.  The static and/or shared results
should be collected as above in *.out files to be sent to me (AWI) for
further analysis.
