plplot (5.0.1-0.potato.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Better descriptions for plplot-c++ and plplot-common
    (thanks to Alan Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>).  Added "Replaces:"
    fields to plplot-xwin and plplot-tcl.  The dependencies now are
    simplified thanks to the use of a virtual package plplot-lib.
  * debian/plplot-doc.files: Removed file.
  * debian/plplot-dev.files: Addded usr/include.  This will put the header
    files into plplot-dev (thanks again to Alan).
  * Created new package plplot-bin with pltek, plpr and plm2gif, which
    were before in plplot-common.  This was causing circular dependency
    problems. 
  * debian/plplot-common.files: Get some files that were wrongly going
    into the "empty" package plplot.

plplot (5.0.1-0.potato.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Starting with version 5.0.0, PLplot entered a
    new development phase.  The project is now hosted at SourceForge
    (http://plplot.sourceforge.net) and the current Debian maintainer is
    also involved with upstream development.  
  * This release works with potato (hence the release number).
  * There has been an overall reorganisation of the packages.  There is
    now a package called plplot-common, containing the data files.
    plplot-xwin and plplot-tcl are both exclusive and contain the shared
    libs.  plplot-c++ has the C++ bindings shared lib.  python-plplot is
    working with Python 1.5 and has been reintroduced.  plplot-doc is for
    now just a boilerplate package, waiting for the DocBook docs to be
    introduced in PLplot 5.0.2.
  * Prompt flush for pltcl is working now (closes: #58273). 
  * debian/control: 
    - Upgraded Standards-Version to 3.1.0.  
    - Added Build-Depends. 
    - Forced conflict between plplot and plplot-tcl packages.
    - New descriptions for packages plplot-dev and plplot-doc to reflect
      the fact that examples go into plplot-dev and plplot-doc is just a
      placeholder for future inclusion of the documentation in DocBook
      format. 
    - Updated URL location of the PLplpot website.
    - Reintroduced entry for python-plplot.  Updated its dependency on
      plplot-tcl. 
  * debian/postinst: Place "exit 0" at the right place, allowing debhelper
    added code to be executed (closes: #77997).  Also, removed code for
    installing info manual.  In the future, this will go in pakcage
    plplot-doc. 
  * debian/rules: Major rewrite to reflect the new features of upstream
    build and install.  The main novelty here is the capability of
    doing make install with another $prefix than that used for building.
  * debian/*.{docs,files}: Heavily modified to reflect the new upstream
    version.
  * debian/control-python, debian/fix-tk-path.pl, debian/postrm,
    debian/python-exec-header, debian/python-plplot.postinst.debhelper,
    debian/python-plplot.prerm.debhelper: Removed files. 
  * debian/plplot-980407-plplot-980407-new.patch: Removed this obsolete
    file.

plplot (4.99j-11) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Added --disable-linuxvga to configure options fixing an important bug
    report (closes: #65216).
  * The lib*tk files are moved to the right package now (plplot-tcl).
    This fixes the unnecessary dependency of the bare library package
    (plplot) on the TCl/Tk libraries.

plplot (4.99j-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: 
    - Using option --without-f2c with ./configure.  This should avoid the
      build problems when the package f2c (which provides /usr/bin/fc) is 
      installed (closes: #30944). 
    - Erase empty dir usr/share/doc/examples after dh_movefiles.  This
      prevents the plplot from having junk in it.
  * debian/control: Excluded problematic package python-plplot.  Created
    file debian/control-pyhton for easy reversal in the future (closes:
    #33150).

plplot (4.99j-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added "#define PLPLOT_DOUBLE" to plcdemos.h.  This will allow
    compilation of the examples, due to the lacking of `PLPLOT_DOUBLE'
    definition (Closes: #49120, #36993).  Also added a note in
    plplot-dev.README.Debian indicating how to compile correctly.
  * FHS compliant.
  * Upgraded to Standards-Version 3.0.1 (requires debhelper >= 2.0.68).
  * debian/copyright: Right location for the LGPL.
  * cf/sysconf.in: Added `SHLIB_F77FLAGS="-fpic -fPIC"'.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Sat,  6 Nov 1999 21:01:13 +0100

plplot (4.99j-8) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Recompiled with new release of libc6 (cf discussion in debian-devel
    starting at
    http://www.debian.org/Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9812/msg00998.html). 
  * Changed LDC in cf/sysconf.in to F77 (link with gcc complains because
    it is lacking symbols from g77).

plplot (4.99j-7) frozen unstable; urgency=low, closes=29694 29704

  * Set Conflicts relationship because files were moved around in the
    latest release (Fixes Bug#29694, reported by  Francesco Potorti`
    <F.Potorti@cnuce.cnr.it>).
  * Rebuilt to fix bogus dependency on tkstep8.0 (closes Bug#29704
    reported by Matthias Klose <doko@cs.tu-berlin.de>)

plplot (4.99j-6) frozen unstable; urgency=low, closes=28534

  * Uploading to frozen and unstable.  (The previous release, 4.99j-5, was
    rejected and I never reuploaded it.) 
  * Revamped debian/rules with use of variables for the debian dirs.
  * Corrected typo in plplot-dev.README (closes Bug#28534).
  * No compression of executable exemples in package plplot-doc.
  * Fixed paths only for tk* scripts under /usr/doc/plplot/examples/tk.
  * Fixed permission for plcolor.tcl and tkdemos.tcl.
  * Fixed path for script x16.py (in plplot-doc).
  * Moved library files libMatrix and libplplotdtk from plplot-tcl to
    plplot. 
  * Moved info file from the plplot-doc package to the base package
    plplot: this is the only documentation availalbe for the PLplot API.
  * Fixed typo ("\*") in debhelper compress files.
  * Fixed the problem related to the naming of shared libraries.
  * Improved "Description:" fields in debian/control: 
    - Added "a scientific library" to first line (as suggested by
      Christopher J. Fearnley <cjf@I21.com>).
    - Included URL of PLplot homepage for each package.
  * dh_shlibdeps does not act on package python-plplot.
  * postinst and postrm test now for its argument.
  * Rewrote README.Debian files.

plplot (4.99j-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build with patch from Joao Cardoso <jcardoso@inescn.pt> for Octave
    interface.  The patch file is included in the debian/ directory. 
  * The orig.tar.gz and the diff.gz files were absent from 4.99j-4
    upload.  This is corrected now (bug reported by Paul Slootman
    <paul@wau.mis.ah.nl>).
  * Corrected sed expression for fixing the #! path in Python scripts
  * Corrected bug in debian/compress file which was causing compression of
    executable scripts under usr/doc/plplot/examples.
  * Created plplot-tcl.postinst with a call to ldconfig, as plplot-tcl
    includes shared libraries.
  * Links to the shared library are now Policy compliant, i.e. their names 
    have only one number after .so.
  * debain/shlibs.local is renamed to debian/shlibs, and
    debian/plplot-tcl.shlibs is created.
  * The scripts installed under usr/lib/tcl8.0/plplot/ should not be
    executable.

plplot (4.99j-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/fix-tk-path.pl script is chmod'd in debian/rules files: now
    fixes really first part of Bug#26935.  Fix suggested by Paul Slootman
    <paul@wau.mis.ah.nl>.
  * debian/control: plplot-doc architecture is now "all" and is compiled
    in the binary-indep section of debian/rules (suggested by
    Paul Slootman <paul@wau.mis.ah.nl>).  In order to do that, big changes 
    in debian/rules were done.  Hope I did not screw things up.
  * debian/rules: Corrected hideous bug in chmod mode switches: "chmod -x"
    should be "chmod +x".
  * Corrected some typos in debian/control, debian/copyright.
  * cf/pkg_tcl.in: put number version in libMatrix.so (changed
    README.Debian to document the fix). 
  * Moved libMatrix.so and libMatrix.a to plplot-dev package.
  * Moved libMatrix.so.* and libplplotdtk.so.* to plplot-tcl package, and
    made plplot-dev depend on plplot-tcl (changed debian/control file to
    reflect the changes).
  * I just realized that the upstream Python support works only with
    python-1.4.  I will fix this in the next release.

plplot (4.99j-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: fixing Python path for python scripts is done now with a 
    sed command (get rid of debian/fix-python-path.pl).  Suggested by
    Matthias Klose <doko@cs.tu-berlin.de>.
  * Change in upstream file utils/pltek.c: gcc 2.7.2.3 deprecates the use
    of gets  
  * Corrected file debian/plplot-dev.files, in order to have the files
    libMatrix.* included in the right package (plplot).
  * Make plplot conflict with plplot-dev for versions previous to this
    one, because of the move of libMatrix.*.
  * Changed mode of debian/fix-tk-path.pl script to executable (fixes
    first part of Bug#26935).
  * Building is now done entirely under debian/tmp (fixes second part of
    Bug#26935).
  * Buildning now `with double' instead of `with float', as required for
    the PLplot Octave interface.  Also, all instances of `libplotf*' were
    changed to `libplotd*' (in debian/rules and in debian/*.files).
  * /usr/lib/libplplotdtk.so.* files moved to the plplot package (they were
    in plplot-tcl): this fixes the problem of installing the plplot-dev
    package with a dangling symlink. 
  * Removed file debian/dirs, which had no function at all.
  * Tcl/Tk and Python scripts under /usr/doc/plplot/examples are now
    executable.
  * fix-tk-path.pl: corrected "/example/" -> "/examples/"

plplot (4.99j-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Using debhelper 0.93 : README.Debian files are installed automatically
    by dh_installdocs
  * Fixed some problems found by Matthias Klose <doko@cs.tu-berlin.de>.
    Danke Matthias!
  * Corrected typo in fix-pytho-path.pl, that made all python examples
    have size equal to zero.
  * examples/Makefile has now correct references to /usr directories
  * Scripts under /usr/doc/plplot/examples are no more compressed
  * Tk scripts under /usr/doc/examples/tk have now the right path after
    `#!'
  * Added dependency python-tk to python-plplot
