Description: Scientific plotting library
 PLplot is relatively small, portable, freely distributable, and is rich
 enough to satisfy most users.  It has a wide range of plot types including
 line (linear, log), contour, 3D, fill, and almost 1000 characters
 (including Greek and mathematical) in its extended font set.  The package
 is designed to make it easy to quickly get graphical output; only a
 handful of function calls is typically required.  For more advanced use,
 virtually all aspects of plotting are configurable.
 .
 This package is an empty 'transition' package. It is needed in order to
 transfer smoothly from the plplot packages prior to version 5.0, since the
 naming scheme has been changed. 
 .

 This package contains the common library files (fonts & maps) needed by
 the PLplot libraries, as well as some utility programs like pltek (review
 a Tektronix vector file), plpr (converts a PLplot metafile to a printable
 format), and plm2gif (converts a PLplot metafile to GIF).

Description: Scientific plotting library
 This package provides the basic shared library for PLplot, a scientific
 plotting library.  It contains all drivers, except the Tcl/Tk one (install
 package plplot-tcl if you need them).  Also included is the utility
 program plrender to render PLplot metafiles.
