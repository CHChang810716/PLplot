PLplot is a library of C functions that are useful for making scientific
plots from a program written in C or Fortran.  The PLplot library can be
used to create standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour
plots, 3D plots, mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs
(of the same or different sizes) may be placed on a single page with
multiple lines in each graph.  There are almost 2000 characters in the
extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek
alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  A variety
of output devices are supported and new devices can be easily added by
writing a small number of device dependent routines.  PLplot is in the
public domain, so you can distribute it freely.  It is currently known to
work on the following systems: SUNOS, A/IX, DG/UX, UNICOS, CTSS, VMS,
Amiga/Exec, MS-DOS, OS/2, and NeXT, with more expected.
