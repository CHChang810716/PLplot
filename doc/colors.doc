o New color model.  Palette to consist of three parts: 1) Color map 0 --
fixed colors for plotting axes, lines, labels, whatever.  Maximum number
of colors is 16.  2) Color map 1 -- only referenced indirectly, through
"intensity" levels.  For mapping function values to color levels, through
a user-specified mapping (default mapping given in HLS coordinates;
eventually a nice input mechanism will be available for the Tcl/TK driver
at least).  3) Window manager colors.  Known only to driver.  For example,
if you have a color palette of 256 colors total, you might have 16 colors
in color map 0, leave the 8 or so colors the window manager is using
alone, leaving 232 colors for shading (pretty reasonable).  The idea is to
still get reasonable output even if you have far less colors to choose
from.  The preliminary work here is done but there's still a ways to go.
