This note explains the new PLplot color model.  

Color map 0
-----------

This palette is intended for plotting axes, lines, labels, whatever.  The
entire palette can be changed by calling plscmap0(), and an individual
color is selected by calling plcol0() with the index of the color.
Maximum number of colors is currently 16.

Color map 1
-----------

Used for plots in which the data value is represented by the color.
The location in color map 1 space is specified through a floating point
number between 0 and 1.  This allows continuous tone plots to be made,
depending on the number of colors supported by the driver.

The mapping between data value and color value is made by specifying a
number of "control points".  These points have a color value (in HLS or
RGB space) and a location in color map 1 (from 0 to 1).  Between these
points, linear interpolation is used.  By mapping location in the color
map to function value, or intensity, you can get a smooth variation of
color.  Any number of control points may be specified, located at
arbitrary intensities, although typically 2 - 4 are enough.  Another way
of stating this is that we are traversing a given number of lines through
HLS (or RGB) space as we move through cmap 1 entries.  The control points
at the minimum and maximum intensity (0 and 1) must always be specified.
By adding more control points you can get more variation.  One good
technique for plotting functions that vary about some expected average is
to use an additional 2 control points in the center (intensity ~= 0.5)
that are the same color as the background (typically white for paper
output, black for crt), and same hue as the boundary control points.  This
allows the highs and lows to be very easily distinguished.

Each control point must specify the location in cmap 1 as well as
three coordinates in HLS or RGB space.  The first point MUST correspond
to location = 0, and the last to location = 1.

Bounds on RGB coordinates:
	R,G,B		[0, 1]		magnitude

Bounds on HLS coordinates:
	hue		[0, 360]	degrees
	lightness	[0, 1]		magnitude
	saturation	[0, 1]		magnitude

The inputs to plscmap1l() are:
	itype		0: RGB, 1: HLS
	npts		number of control points
	location[]	location for each control point
	coord1[]	first coordinate for each control point
	coord2[]	second coordinate for each control point
	coord3[]	third coordinate for each control point 


Color map 1 has three defining constants:

1. Number of control points.  You can use few (typical) or many.

2. Number of sampled RGB values.  In theory, these are not needed, since
   you can determine the proper RGB value from the inverse mapping as 
   specified in plscmap1l().  However, to make the inverse a simple
   lookup, I sample a limited number of colors at discrete locations in
   cmap1 space.  Typically 256 are used (high enough that discreteness
   should not be a factor).

3. Maximum number of actual output colors.  This is driver-dependent.
   E.g. it is 16-ncol0-1, where ncol0 is number of colors in cmap0, for
   the tek driver (subtract 1 for the background).  The X driver can
   display many in principle (over 100) but I limit the number due to
   practical considerations (direct rgb, multiple plplot apps, etc).
