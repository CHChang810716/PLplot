This file summarises changes to the cvs of the plplot documentation project.
For some background about that project see README. Alan W. Irwin (AWI) and
Rafael Laboissiere (RL) have been the principal contributors to this project
so far.

2000 November 4 (AWI): extensive changes to Makefile.in plus split
functionality of old README into README plus CHANGES.

2000 November 3 (AWI): Refined configuration so that it worked on both
Debian/potato and RedHat 6.2 (with a workaround for the broken principal
catalog for that system).  Also made extensive changes to
../README.developers.

2000 October 30-31 (RL): Generalized configuration method using autoconf,
configure.in approach.

2000 October 19 (AWI and RL): added the plplot docbook documentation project
to the sourceforge cvs repository at location plplot/doc/docbook-sgml.  The
source was http://www.icp.inpg.fr/~rafael/plplotdoc/src with some additional
files (jatex.cfg and over-under.tex) added later by RL. eps2jpeg.pl and the
Makefile were then modified to make the build work on Debian/potato.
