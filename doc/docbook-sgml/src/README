This plplot docbook documentation project was originally a joint effort by
Alan W. Irwin (AWI) and Rafael Laboissiere (RL) to convert the plplot
latexinfo documentation (last modified in 1995 or earlier) to the docbook
sgml format.  The motivations for the project are discussed at
http://www.icp.inpg.fr/~rafael/plplotdoc.  We essentially finished the
conversion project in July 1999 and suspended further improvements to the
documentation until we had more time and plplot cvs access.

As of 19 October 2000 the project was added to the cvs
(plplot/doc/docbook-sgml) by AWI.

To make the local copy before the install he used

wget --recursive --level=2 http://www.icp.inpg.fr/~rafael/plplotdoc/src/

wget buries the results in the local directory
www.icp.inpg.fr/~rafael/plplotdoc/src/ so I moved the ..../src stuff to here
and rm -rf www.icp.inpg.fr

jatex.cfg and over-under.tex were missing from the web site and were
supplied independently by RL.  On Debian potato the eps2jpeg.pl file no
longer worked properly and had to be modified by Rafael. AWI then modified
the Makefile to get it to work properly on his Debian potato system.  These
source files and this README were then added to the plplot cvs repository in
the directory plplot/doc/docbook-sgml on 19 October 2000.  All further
changes to the docbook documentation will be made using that repository.  In
the near term AWI plans to mostly work on improving the actual words in the
documentation (e.g., a number of API descriptions are still missing) while
RL plans to convert from the sgml to XML form of docbook and *possibly*
generalize the Makefile to work on systems other than Debian/potato.
