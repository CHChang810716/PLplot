	* plplotdoc-print.dsl.in, plplotdoc-html.dsl.in (element
	funcprototype): Definition changed from element funcsynopsis to
	adapt to DocBook XML 4.1.  This fixes the funny looking boxes in
	the printed version of the manual.

	* Makefile.am (print): Added dvi file as a dependency.
	($(BASE).dvi, $(BASE).jadetex): These rules are not pattern rules
	anymore.  Their targets are not erased after completion.
