  <title>API compatibility definition</title>

  <para>
    This chapter presents the formal definition of what is considered to be
    in the PLplot library API.  The PLplot developers commit to introduce
    backwards compatibilities as few as possible, such that stability
    across releases is practically guaranteed.  However, in the eventuality
    that the interface or the behavior of any function in the API changes,
    then the library soname will be changed (in systems that support
    versioned shared libraries).

      What is in the API?
    </title>

    <para>
      The formal definition of the PLplot C API is everything that is defined
      in the include file <filename>plplot.h</filename>.  This includes all
      the function prototypes, the defined structures and the semantics of
      the constants.  The list of symbols currently exported by the shared
      library <filename>libplplot.h</filename> that are declared in
      <filename>plplot.h</filename> is the following:

    <title>
      Regression test for backwards compatibility
    </title>

    <para>
      Since PLplot is developed by so many people, the task of checking for
      backwards compatiblity of the library is very hard.  As for the 5.3.1
      release, we do not have any rigorous regression test for check
      whether the library is really backwards compatible.
    </para>

    <para>
      However, here are some rules to be followed by the Release Manager
      prior to releasing a new version of PLplot:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Check if there are any changes in
            <filename>plplot.h</filename>.  If no prototype is changed,
            then the chances are high that no backwards compatibilities
            have been introduced.  If new functions has been added, then
            the library soname will be kept, although the libtool version
            string in <filename>configure.ac</filename> must be changed
            from x:y:z to (x+1):0:(z+1).  See the
            <application>libtool</application> manual for details.
        </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            A necessary, but not sufficient test consists of the following:
            first, install the previous released version of PLplot in the
            system and compile all the examples
            <filename>examples/c/x??c.</filename>.  After that, install the
            to-be-released version of PLplot and try to run the examples.
            If they either link and run incorrectly, then backwards
            compatibilities have been added and the version string should
            be upgraded from x:y:z to (x+1):0:0.
