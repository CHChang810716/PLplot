<chapter id="API-OBSOLETE">
  <title>Obsolete/Deprecated API for PLplot</title>

  <para>
    The purpose of this chapter is to provide minimal documentation for
    obsolete/deprecated API that appears in our C library to provide backwards
    compatibility until these functions
    disappear.  Do not use these functions, and if you already use them
    in legacy PLplot applications, replace them by the suggested
    equivalents so you won't be caught out when they disappear.
