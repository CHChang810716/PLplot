<chapter id="x-drivers">
  <title>The PLplot X Driver Family</title>

  <para>
    There are several drivers for working with the MIT X Windows
    system. Beginning with PLplot 5.0, the following drivers are supported.
  </para>

  <sect1 id="xwin-driver">
    <title>The Xwin Driver</title>
    
    <para> 
      The Xwin driver draws plots in an X-window using Xlib.  The raster
      output is rather coarse, but renders very fast.  The Xwin driver
      is excellent for quick-look plots, and is the reference driver
      for plplot.  However, it should be noted that the Xwin driver 
      is not unicode-enabled.
    </para>

    <para>
      The Xwin driver displays plots one page at a time.  The pager
      is advanced by pressing the Enter key.
    </para> 
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gcw-driver">
    <title>The GCW Driver</title>
    
    <para> 
      The GCW (Gnome Canvas Widget) driver produces high-quality output
      in a Gnome window, but renders slower than the Xwin driver.  The
      GCW driver can also be used to embed plots in Gnome applications,
      and this is described in the section on Embedding Plots in Gnome
      Applications.  The GCW driver is unicode enabled.
    </para>

    <para>
      Plots are presented in separate tabs.  There are a variety of hot keys
      that may be used:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Arrows : Change page</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>+ : Zooms in</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>- : Zooms out</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>= : Zooms to 100%</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>q : Quits</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
      </sect1>

  <sect1 id="tk-driver">
    <title>The Tk Driver</title>
    
    <para> 
      is the prototype of a whole new interaction paradigm.  See next
      chapter.
    </para>

  </sect1>

</chapter>

<chapter id="output-drivers">
  <title>The PLplot Output Driver Family</title>

  <para>
    There are several drivers which produce output files to be displayed by
    another system.  Beginning with PLplot 5.0, the following drivers are 
    supported.
  </para>

  <sect1 id="postscript-driver">
    <title>The Postscript Driver</title>
    
    <para> 
      The Postscript driver produces publication-quality postscript
      output.  This driver is unicode enabled.
    </para>

    <para>
    </para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="gd-driver">
    <title>The GD Driver</title>
    
    <para> 
      The GD driver is used to produce high-quality png, jpeg, and 
      gif images, using devices by the same name.  All of the GD 
      devices are unicode enabled.
    </para>
