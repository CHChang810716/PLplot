  <title>The PLplot Libraries</title>

  <para>
    The purpose of this chapter is give an overview of the libraries that
    are created as part of a PLplot build.  These consist of bindings
    libraries to make the PLplot API accessible for various computer
    languages or GUI environments, the PLplot core library which
    implements the PLplot API in C, enhancement libraries which add
    essential functionality the PLplot core library, and device-driver
    libraries which help to implement some of our device drivers.
  </para>

  <sect1 id="bindings-libraries">
    <title>Bindings Libraries</title>
    <para>
      The purpose of the PLplot bindings is to make the PLplot API
      documented in <xref linkend="API"/> accessible from various computer
      languages and GUI environments.  For compiled applications (GUI or
      otherwise) this is implemented using bindings libraries which must be
      specifically linked by the application.  (See the Makefiles in the
      installed examples tree for comprehensive examples of how we use
      <command>pkg-config</command> to supply the necessary linking
      information.)  In turn these bindings libraries are linked to the
      PLplot core library described in <xref linkend="core-library"/>.
      We tabulate below the bindings library or libraries associated with
      the compiled languages and GUI environments we support.  (In contrast,
      for non-compiled languages such as Python or Tcl, the PLplot bindings
      are made accessible using shared objects or plugins which are
      dynamically loaded by the language at user request.)

    <title>The PLplot Core Library</title>
    <para>
      The PLplot core library is written in C and implements the PLplot API
      documented in <xref linkend="API"/>.  The name of that core
      library is libplplot.  libplplot links to the enhancement libraries
      documented in <xref linkend="enhancement-libraries"/>.  libplplot
      also normally dynamically loads devices (a build mode is also available
      to put the driver code right into the core library) which in
      turn can potentially link to device-driver libraries that are
      described in <xref linkend="device-driver-libraries"/>.
