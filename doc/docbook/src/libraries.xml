  <title>The PLplot Libraries</title>

  <para>
    The purpose of this chapter is to document the libraries that
    are created as part of a PLplot build.  These consist of language
    bindings libraries to make the PLplot API accessible for various
    computer languages or GUI environments, the PLplot core library
    which implements the PLplot API in C, drivers libraries which help to
    implement some of our device drivers, and enhancement libraries which add
    key functionality required by the PLplot core library.
