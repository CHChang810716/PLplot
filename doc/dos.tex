\section{MS-DOS}

The DOS implementation of PLplot is based on the OS/2 version.  The main 
difference being that the DOS version has a VGA driver.  The VGA driver
uses calls to the Microsoft graphics functions supplied with C 6.0 and
QC 2.0 and above.  If you wish to use a different compiler which does not
support the Microsft graphics functions, you will need to make a new driver,
presumably based on the code structure of the existing Microsoft specific
driver.
This is not difficult however, so should not be perceived as a significant
obstacle.  Send in the new driver and they'll be incorporated into future
versions for everyone's benefit.

In particular, the compilers used to develop the DOS version are the same
as for the OS/2 version: Microsft C 6.0 and Fortran 5.0.  Further, the
installation procedure is identical, except get the makefile from
{\tt plplot$\backslash$sys$\backslash$dos}.  Note that it is not possible
to make a bound version of PLplot or of {\tt plrender} since the DOS VGA
driver contains code which cannot be bound.  

See the README file in {\tt sys$\backslash$dos} for information not
contained herein.
