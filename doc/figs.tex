\newsection{Figure Captions}

The figures are all output from the PLplot Fortran example programs.
These are practically identical to the example programs written in C,
except for the addition of a polar contour plot in example program 9.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Example program 1 output showing different styles of line plots.

\item
Example program 2 output showing color plots (not so impressive
in black and white).

\item
Example program 3 output showing polar plotting.

\item
Example program 4 output showing logarithmic plotting and multiple scales
per plot.

\item
Example program 5 output showing histograms.

\item
Example program 6 output showing the standard font.

\item
Example program 7 output showing the extended font.

\item
Example program 8 output showing 3-d plotting.

\item
Example program 9 output showing contour plotting.

\item
Example program 10 output showing absolute plotting.

\item
Example program 11 output showing mesh plotting.

\item
Example program 12 output showing histogram plotting with shading.

\item
Example program 13 output showing a pie chart.

\end{enumerate}
