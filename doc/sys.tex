\chapter{System dependent usage and installation}
\label{ap:sys}

Here are listed notes for PLPLOT usage and installation on various systems.
The user must have access to the proper PLPLOT library(s), utilities ({\tt
plrender} and optionally {\tt pltek}), and runtime access to the required
font files ({\tt plstnd4.fnt, plxtnd4.fnt}).  It is best to supplement these
notes with a site-dependent document outlining the exact procedure for using
PLPLOT.

Eventually we may make available the PLPLOT library binaries for different
machines via anonymous ftp, but for now users typically must build the
package themselves unless the site adminstrator has done so already.
Typically this will entail unpacking the .zoo or .tar PLPLOT source archive
on your system, making appropriate changes to set up the makefile or script
files, and then letting the computer take over.  A complete build of PLPLOT
will typically take only a few minutes on a fast workstation.  Systems
that are currently on the ``officially'' supported list should pose few
difficulties (we hope).  If you find that your system and/or compiler
require changes to the makefile and/or header files, feel free to contact us
about including these in the next PLPLOT release.
