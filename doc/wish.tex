Beginning with PLplot 5.0, a new and powerful paradigm for interaction
with PLplot is introduced.  This new paradigm consists of an
integration of PLplot with a powerful scripting language (Tcl), and
extensions to that language to support X Windows interface development
(Tk) and object oriented programming ([incr Tcl]).  Taken together,
these four software systems (Tcl/Tk/itcl/PLplot) comprise a powerful
environment for the rapid prototyping and development of
sophisticated, flexible, X Windows applications with access to the
PLplot API.  Yet that is only the beginning--Tcl was born to be
extended.  The true power of this paradigm is achieved when you add
your own, powerful, application specific extensions to the above
quartet, thus creating an environment for the development of wholly
new applications with only a few keystrokes of shell programming ...
