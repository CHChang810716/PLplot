These java examples are designed to mimic the results of the equivalent
C, Tcl, and Python examples.  

Here is the cookbook for compiling and running these examples.

(1) Install a Java SDK (Software Development Kit).  I use
IBMJava2-SDK-14.tgz which is freely downloadable from IBM.  (See
http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/linux/tested.html for product
description.) Plplot is also known to work with the Sun JDK, gcj/gij and 
jikes/sablevm.

(2) Set environment variables (under tcsh.  For bash use the export
variable=value syntax.) Depending on your installation this step may be 
optional.
# Your location for the java SDK will vary depending on where you unpack the
# tarball of the SDK.
setenv JAVA_HOME /home/software/java/IBMJava2-14/
setenv PATH $PATH":$JAVA_HOME/bin"

(3) (This next step is no longer required because it is done
automatically by make install.)  To build the installed examples:
cd /usr/local/plplot/lib/
javac -d java java/plplot/examples/*.java

(4) Run java demos

# For newer jdk's can use the plplot/examples/x?? notation, but the dot
# notation works for all jdk's.

# This location will depend on your install prefix:
setenv CLASSPATH /usr/local/share/plplot5.3.1/java/plplot.jar
java plplot.examples.x01 .....

All the plplot java bindings and examples are contained in the jar file
plplot.jar. In the above case the source for the examples would be in 
/usr/local/share/plplot5.3.1/examples/java/
