-- initialise Lua bindings for PLplot examples.

The Lua 5.0 stanza below was temporarily tested for Lua 5.2 by
changing "Lua 5.0" to Lua 5.2 and converting all loadlib calls to
package.loadlib.  That test was a success (as was a test for the
non-Lua-5.0 stanza below when these temporary changes were removed)
when LIBRARY_TARGET_PREFIX was non-null (which occurs when the user
uses the -DTEST_BUILD_TREE_WRITEABLE_LIBRARY_TARGETS=ON option).  So
likely a real Lua 5.0 environment will work, but that has not
been explicitly tested.
