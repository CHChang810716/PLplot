Bugs fixed, features added.
--------------------------

All known bugs in ps driver fixed.  Includes problems with orientation,
previous use of "~" as a negation operator instead of "!" as it should have
been. 

All drivers should now support the orientation switch properly.

Warnings for eliminated driver code has been eliminated by adding a dummy
variable to the head of each.

plrender now rotates the plot in the proper direction for -ori 1.  In
addition, you may specify -ori -1 to rotate the other way, and -ori 2 or -ori
-2 to rotate around by a full 180 degrees.

A null device driver (ie. no graphics output) for debugging purposes has been
added.

Adjustments to the default character height should now work properly.
