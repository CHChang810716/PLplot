Installing the fonts:

You need to build the fonts (*.fnt, *.idx and *.lkp files) fresh on each
platform.  These files are portable across machines which use the same byte
order in a word.  Big endian machines are those for which the most
significant byte of a short occupies the higher address in memory.  This
includes all Motorola 68xxx machines and several others.  Some little
endian machines include those based on Intel CPU's, DEC Vaxes, and Crays.
You can compile the program to create the standard font with something like

cc -o stndfont stndfont.c font*.c

Run this program and then repeat for xtndfont.c.  The best way is simply
to type

make fonts

using the supplied makefile.

When you are finished, you must copy all of the created files to one of
the directories in the plplot font search path for your system (see the
documentation or plfont.c for more info).
