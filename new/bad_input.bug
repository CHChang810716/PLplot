that I'm too sick to find.

If you plot a flat function:

	No problem when output is X window.

	crash if output device is plmetafile

What xdb says is:
floating point exception (no ignore) at 0x00055070
(file unknown): wcpcy +0x00000088: (line unknown)
>

isn't wcpcy a plplot routine?

I sure wish you had debugging versions of the libs installed.  I had
to build debuggable utils and step through the code.  Eventually I
found it was dying in plbox.  The thought of compiling plplot with
debug just so I could track this bug has left me nonplussed.

All this time I've thought there was a bug in my program...
