Maurice,

Herer's my latest update of the whole PLPLOT distribution.  

Several things to note:

I added DOS386 via GCC stuff.  I think that's new since you saw it last,
but maybe not.  Don't remember.

I updated the sys/unis/makefile.m4 for use with LINUX, my new operating
system :-).

stndfont.c does not work on LINUX, unfortunately.  I stuck a modified copy
of it in plplot/new.  Please leave it there till I get this problem
resolved. 

I fixed some stuff in the docs.  In particular, I added a file for DOS 386.
This one was in the version of the manual most recently printed for the
IFS.  Tonight I added one for LINUX.  It will probably be removed once the
stndfont.c problem is fixed.  I also made some changes to the unix.tex
file.  There was a place where metafile should've been makefile, and I also
noticed that the installation instructios had  become dated with respect to
the fonts.  So I added a pp at the end.  You might want to kill it and just
fix the prior note, but I'll let you decide.

Anyway, things are looking good now.  It correctly builds on SUNOS, DOS and
OS/2, DOS 386, and my new LINUX.

The only thing I am aware of which is still broken is the ljii.c file.

Also, there are still some files which don't fit the 8.3 form factor.
Mainly I'm thinking of those in the top level plplot directory.  How about
changing them to be 8.3 as well?

Geoff
