# -dev tk fails to work for any of these.
# -dev wxwidgets will work on one at a time, but segfaults
# for multiple examples.
# -dev xcairo very slow on all of these (the well-known interactive
# slowness issue
# with that device).
# The following comments are for -dev qtwidget.
# 11 (many invalid limits);
# 12 (hangs);
# 14 (looks pretty to start but then segfaults);
# 17 (error: plrb: device is not xor capable);
# 18 (pthread_mutex_lock.c:285:)
# 19 (failed to exit properly);
# 20 (failed to exit properly);
# 21 (plot was just dark background)

# -dev wxwidgets had similar issues except possibly for examples 18
# and 19 which seemed fine, but there is no way to tell for sure with
# second wxwidgets example (no matter what) always segfaulting.

# -dev xwin worked except for the following:
# 11 (many invalid limits);
# 14 (locked xterm);
# 19 (failed to exit properly);
# 20 (failed to exit properly);
# 21 (plot was just dark background)
# Drop everything that fails to work for -dev xwin except for 21.
