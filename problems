	Some members of the Plasma Physics Dept here at Sydney University
have tried to call PLPLOT subroutines from Pascal, without any success. Our
SUN Pascal compiler seems to stick underscore characters after function names
so that the linker then complains of not being able to find plstar_, plenv_
etc. in the libplplotf.a archive. Can you offer any advice?

It would be nice if the PostScript driver had the %%BoundingBox line at the
top of the file, as some programs (eg. dvi to ps translators) have
trouble recognizing "%%Bounding Box : (at end)".

Devices & streams currently all mixed up.

Timings:
 o The dashed line draws are incredibly slow and should be optimized.
 o A polyline capability would speed up plrender by a lot.
