Tk
Programming Tk

<P>
As mentioned above, Tcl is designed to be extensible.  The first and
most basic Tcl extension is Tk, an X11 toolkit.  Tk provides the same
basic facilities that you may be familiar with from other X11 toolkits
such as Athena and Motif, except that they are provided in the context
of the Tcl language.  There are C bindings too, but these are seldom
needed-the vast majority of useful Tk applications can be coded using
Tcl scripts.

<P>
If it has not become obvious already, it is worth noting at this point
that Tcl is one example of a family of languages known generally as
``Very High Level Languages'', or VHLL's.  Essentially a VHLL raises
the level of programming to a very high level, allowing very short
token streams to accomplish as much as would be required by many
scores of the more primitive actions available in a basic HLL.
Consider, for example, the basic ``Hello World!'' application written
in Tcl/Tk.
<PRE>
#!/usr/local/bin/wish -f

button .hello -text "Hello World!"  -command "destroy ."
pack .hello
</PRE>
<P>
That's it!  That's all there is to it.  If you have ever programmed X
using a traditional toolkit such as Athena or Motif, you can
appreciate how amazingly much more convenient this is.  If not, you
can either take our word for it that this is 20 times less code than
you would need to use a standard toolkit, or you can go write the same
program in one of the usual toolkits and see for yourself...

<P>
We cannot hope to provide a thorough introduction to Tk programming in
this section.  Instead, we will just say that immensely complex
applications can be constructed merely by programming in exactly the
way shown in the above script.  By writing more complex scripts, and
by utilizing the additional widggets provided by Tk, one can create
beautiful, extensive user interfaces.  Moreover, this can be done in a
tiny fraction of the time it takes to do the same work in a
conventional toolkit.  Literally minutes versus days.

<P>
Tk provides widgets for labels, buttons, radio buttons, frames with or
without borders, menubars, pull downs, toplevels, canvases, edit
boxes, scroll bars, etc.

<P>
A look at the interface provided by the PLplot Tk and Tcl-DP drivers
should help give you a better idea of what you can do with this
paradigm.  Also check out some of the contributed Tcl/Tk packages
available at harbor.  There are high quality Tk interfaces to a great
many familiar unix utilites ranging from mail to info, to SQL, to
news, etc.  The list is endless and growing fast...
