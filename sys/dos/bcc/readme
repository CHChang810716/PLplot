[note: I modified the driver file to reflect changes to plplot4.99d.
I have no way of testing it, however. -mjl]

Modifications for use with the Borland C compiler and BGI graphics :

- a makefile for Borland's make

[needs to be updated -mjl]

- included the bgi-driver routines in drivers.h and plcore.h

[I have modified the main sources accordingly -mjl]

- include <alloc.h> in xtndfont.c
  (if omitted xtndfont hangs my pc)

[not moved to main sources since there's no alloc.h on my HP.  I'm surprised
it isn't included by malloc.h, which is presumably being included by plplotP.h
if MSDOS is defined by the compiler.  In any case, this file isn't really
needed because the font files are now portable and don't need to be
regenerated. -mjl]

- moved an increment outside an expression in function pldeco (plstring.c)
  (if this is not done the length of the string remains 0 and no
  strings are visible.Because of a bug in Borland C ??).

[I put this fix in the main sources -mjl]


Other bgi drivers for SVGA cards can be found on SIMTEL and mirrors.

To install it I started from plplot4p99.zip
Put all files in \plplot\sys\dosbgi

copy makefile \plplot\tmp
cd \pgplot\tmp
make links  (copies all files to \pgplot\tmp)
make        (makes the library)
make fonts  (make the .fnt files)
make x01c   (make an example)
...

I would appreciate your comments.
