Other bgi drivers for SVGA cards can be found on SIMTEL and mirrors.

To install it I started from plplot4p99.zip
Put all files in \plplot\sys\dosbgi

copy makefile \plplot\tmp
cd \pgplot\tmp
make links  (copies all files to \pgplot\tmp)
make        (makes the library)
make fonts  (make the .fnt files)
make x01c   (make an example)
...

I would appreciate your comments.
