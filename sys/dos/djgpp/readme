Hello,

Here's my Makefile for dos386/djgpp.  It combines the original
dos386/makefile with your new makefiles.  I've set it up to use f2c to
compile the fortran stubs.  By default it outputs two separate
libraries as before - one for plplot and the other for the fortran
stubs.

The f2c stuff is easy to implement or replace. "f2c -A file.f; gcc
file.c; del file.c" is equivalent to "f77 file.f".  Of course the
libf2c.a library is needed for linking.  F2c for djgpp is best
retrieved from the same site as djgpp - the file to look for is
tpf2c100.zip (or such like).
