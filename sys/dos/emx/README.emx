[EMX : readme.doc]

Welcome to emx 0.8h, a common environment for creating 32-bit programs
for OS/2 2.x and DOS.  You can use the GNU C compiler to compile
programs for emx.  The main design goal of emx is to simplify porting
Unix software to OS/2 2.x and DOS.  Moreover, you can create `native'
OS/2 programs, including Presentation Manager applications.

emx does not come with a `make' utility.  I recommend dmake 3.8.  It's
available for anonymous ftp on

  ftp.uni-stuttgart.de [129.69.8.13]: /pub/systems/os2/programming/support/
  ftp-os2.cdrom.com:  [192.153.46.2]: /os2/all/program/
  ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de [131.159.0.198]:
                                      /pub/comp/os/os2/devtools/

Executables are in dmake38x.zip, source code is in dmake38s.zip.
dmake38.zip contains both dmake38s.zip and dmake38x.zip.

The emx graphics library currently supports only the 320x200 VGA mode.
Johannes Martin has created a graphics library for various SVGA cards.
