This latest version of the PLPLOT package incorporates numerous enhancements
to the prior version.  The package is designed to use MS 6 for the C compiler 
and MS Fortran 5 for the Fortran compiler.  The makefile will build the 
package once you have your environment set up correctly.  The accompanying
plconfig.cmd shows how I have my system set up.  You will need to adjust the
paths and etc to match your own system configuration.

Once these matters are resolved, build the package via:
	nmake links
	nmake
	nmake fonts
	nmake demos
	
You can set PLFONTS=dir to get plplot to recognize wherever you decide
to keep your fonts.  \lib seems like a logical choice on my system.
