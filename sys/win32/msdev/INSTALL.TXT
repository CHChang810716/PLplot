Installation instructions for the win32/msdev port of plplot
============================================================

1. Introduction

This file contains information on how to compile and run the 
plplot library using MS Visual C++ on PCs running MS Windows 
98/NT/2000 (the current distribution has not been tested on 
neither 95 nor XP however it should normally work on these 
two versions of Windows as well.) 

Please note that the work on the win32/msdev port is under 
progress. These instructions will tell you how to build
the plplot.lib library and all the C examples except x14c
and x17c. However, the work on the plplot.dll is not yet
finished. For more information about the win32/msdev port 
of plplot please see plplot/sys/win32/msdev/README.TXT.


2. Requirements

You'll need MS Visual C++ version 5, 6 or higher for building 
plplot. You might be able to use an earlier version of Visual C++ 
but you will probably not be able to use the provided makfiles.
You will also need to make sure that you can execute the "nmake"
command on a MS-DOS promt command line. 


3. Source files

You can extract the sources of plplot in any directory you want.


4. Compilation

  4.1 Open a MS-DOS prompt window.
  4.2 Change directory to plplot\sys\win32\msdev
  4.3 Type "nmake". The files needed for the compilation of
      plplot will be copied to plplot\tmp.
  4.4 Change directory to plplot\sys\win32\msdev\plplib.
  4.5 Type "nmake plplib.mak". The plplot.lib library will
      be built and placed in the same directory.
  4.6 Change directory to plplot\sys\win32\msdev\Examples.
  4.7 Type "nmake Examples.mak". All C examples will be 
      built except x14c and x17c in the plplot/tmp
      directory. (For comments about the examples see
      plplot\sys\win32\msdev\README.TXT.)


5. Running plplot

You can run the C examples directly from plplot\tmp. However,
if you would like to run your programs in a different directory
you have to make sure that plplot can find the font files
(located in plplot/lib with the extension .fnt):

  5.1 Set the environment variable PLPLOT_HOME to point to
      where you have installed plplot, e.g.
        SET PLPLOT_HOME="C:\PLPLOT"
      (see plplot\FAQ number 1.12)
  5.2 or simply make sure that the font files are in the same
      directory where you execute your plplot program.


6. Comments & suggestions

If you have comments or suggestions on how to improve the
win32/msdev port of plplot please dont't hesitate to contact
