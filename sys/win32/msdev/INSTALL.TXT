1 - Copy files to tmp with
    nmake
2 - create the static and/or dynamic library by opening
    plplib\plplib.mak and plpdll\plpdll.mak in Microsoft Visual C.
3 - install the libraries with
    nmake install
    Do not forget to do this each time you recreate a library.
4 - If you use the dynamic library :
    - \plplot\bin should be in your path.
    - define NOBRAINDEAD in the preprocessor definitions of the project 
      settings
    - plfill is defined as void WINAPI plfill(...) which is incompatible
      with it's use inside the plplot library.
      If you pass it as a parameter to e.g. plshade it is necessary to 
      create a stub :
        void myfill(PLINT n,PLFLT *x,PLFLT *y) {
          plfill(n,x,y);
        }
      and pass this as an argument to plshade.
