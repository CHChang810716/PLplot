# This is called from plplot-test.sh with $device, $dsuffix,
# and $options defined.
# N.B. $CLASSPATH must be defined properly and the path must point
# to the java and javac commands for this to work.

# The java examples were automatically built in the make install step
# by cd $prefix/lib
# javac -d java java/plplot/examples/*.java.
# This is equivalent to
# javac -d $CLASSPATH $CLASSPATH/plplot/examples/*.java
# but means that $CLASSPATH does not have to be set at build
# or install time like it does to execute these pre-compiled examples.

# Do the standard non-interactive examples.
# skip 14 because it requires two output files.
# skip 19 because it is not implemented
# skip 17, and 20 because they are interactive and not implemented.
# skip 21 because it delivers variable results depending on computer timing
# and load and is not implemented.
