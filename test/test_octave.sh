# Test suite for octave demos.  
# This is called from plplot-test.sh with $octavedir, $driver, and 
# $dsuffix defined.
# Currently this file is just a placeholder until the generation of
# postscript files (at least, and hopefully the rest of the file drivers
# as well) becomes more reliable under octave.
