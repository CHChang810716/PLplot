The purpose of this complete project is to provide a simple Ada test case
consisting of an Ada executable calling a single routine in an Ada library
which prints out the classic "hello, world" phrase.  This complete project
includes a CMake-based build system and files for Ada language support
within CMake which will eventually become part of CMake itself.

To run the test

(1) create an empty build directory and cd to it.
mkdir build_dir

(2) configure project with cmake
cmake path/to/this/source/directory

(3) build library and executable that links to it
make

(4) run test that should generate "hello, world" phrase.

src_executable/hello

In sum, this project provides a simple demonstration of how to use the CMake
Ada language support and at the same time tests the quality of that support
for various user's platforms.  If any user is having trouble with CMake
Ada language support, this is the simple test case they should run first.
