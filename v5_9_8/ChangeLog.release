Implement do_clean_as_you_go option to clean up as you go.  However, it
does not work well, yet, because the custom commands OUTPUT files
just refer to the files from the first example rather than all 33 so
those first example files are the only ones cleaned (so far).

ToDo (some time in next release cycle) implement complete OUTPUT files
for custom commands.

Change launch of ctest job to execution of ctest.  This probably takes
longer (at least until we make ctest parallel), but it does allow
clean up afterwards since this change makes ctest end become

Code reorganization in preparation for calculating complete bounding box
and position of the labelled and decorated colorbar.

Systematically use the mm form of bounding box limits,
plsc->boxbb_xmin, etc., rather than the confusing mixture of that form
and one where the limits are expressed in normalized subpage
coordinates.

Implement the static function, calculate_limits, to isolate in one
place all the limit changes due to a changed bounding box.  The first
call of this function is associated with changing the bounding box and
corresponding position calculation from the undecorated colorbar to
the decorated (ticks, numerical tick labels, and exponents) colorbar.
The second call of this function (not yet used) will be associated
with changing the bounding box and corresponding position
calculationfrom the decorated colorbar to the labelled and decorated
colorbar.

However, the calculate_limits code is not yet fully
understood/documented (since it just collected pre-existing code which
was not fully understood/documented into a static function) so the
second call is not used yet.

As expected, the result is identical to the previous commit, i.e.,
labels are currently ignored in the bounding box calculation and in
the calculation of the position of that bounding box in the overall
plot.

Fix accident waiting to happen for get_subpage_per_mm (a static
function which is called directly or indirectly by pllegend and plcolorbar).

The only reason this function worked correctly before was it was always
called after

plvpor( 0., 1., 0., 1. );
plwind( 0., 1., 0., 1. );

But the point is the get_subpage_per_mm doesn't need to know anything
about the viewport, and a call to plgspa returns all data required to
calculate the x and y ratios of normalized subpage coordinates to mm.
So get_subpage_per_mm can be substantially simplified, and that
simplification insures that routine will give correct results when
plvpor and plwind have been called with other than the above values.

However, a vertical offset issue for the pdf device driver that was

the entire string downwards (including all text before when "#u" is

used) has no such effect.  I have looked hard for the origin of this
pdf bug but cannot find the source of it.  The superscript and
subscript paths are absolutely identical in the code except for the
numerical calculation of dev->yOffset.  So why does the correct offset
from the baseline being calculated in both cases affect the overall

Implement a private plP_script_scale function that calculates scale
values for font size and magnitude of the vertical offset associated
with superscripts/subscripts.  Currently, the font scale and offset
calculations associated with superscripts and subscripts are done in
an idiosyncratic (and often incorrect) way in various locations within
the core code and drivers.  plP_script_scale is designed to
consolidate those bits of logic in one place where the calculation is
done correctly.

As a first use of this new logic, use plP_script_scale for the Hershey
font superscripts/subscripts. plP_script_scale produces completely
symmetrical vertical offsets between superscripts and subscripts.
Therefore, this change corrects a very long-standing error (since
before 1993) in the vertical offset of the Hershey subscripts which
previously were not consistent with the magnitude of the vertical
offsets of the superscripts.

I have discovered experimentally that contrary to the documentation at
http://developer.gnome.org/pango/unstable/PangoMarkupFormat.html, rise 
is in units of 1024th of a point (i.e., a real distance unit) rather
than in units of the (variable) font size.  Implement a correction the 
accounts properly for the real units of rise. The result is the actual
superscript/subscript vertical offsets that are rendered by cairo
devices now is (correctly) proportional to the font size (as opposed 
to being fixed in size before).  This correction solves the second
issue noted in the previous commit.

The cairo and PLplot character coordinate system have vertical zero
points of respectively the baseline of the fonts and the middle of the
vertical dimension of the fonts. This mismatch in coordinate systems
means the superscript/subscript offsets appear asymmetrical for cairo
devices compared to -dev xwin (i.e., issue 1 noted in the previous
commit message).  An approximation for this coordinate shift has been
implemented, and the asymmetry appears to be greatly reduced as a
result.

Implement an additional test which superimposes exponent data you
obtain with badly scaled axes for plbox with similar (using an

offsets (and good values for those offsets) between the plbox and
direct calls to plmtex for -dev xwin and -dev xcairo.  Thus, it does
not verify the bad vertical plbox exponent offsets that you get for
example 33 using -dev xcairo (but not -dev xwin)

Better tuning of superscript/subscript offsets to match algorithm used
for plstr code in plsym.c that is used for Hershey fonts (e.g., -dev
xwin).

However, there are still at least two superscript/subscript bugs for
the cairo devices.

1. test_superscript_subscript.py results show that the vertical
   offsets for superscripts with -dev xcairo largely match those from
   -dev xwin.  This is expected because it was those offsets I used to
   tune the cairo device driver.  However, the subscript vertical
   offsets are slightly too large in magnitude, i.e., the subscript
   is placed too low compared to the corresponding superscript.
   Off by 1 error for subscripts?
   
2. The plbox axis exponents that occur for badly scaled axis
coordinates are written using plmtex.  I mimic those plmtex calls with
test_superscript_subscript.py.  As expected, the exponent strings from
plbox and test_superscript_subscript.py with -dev xwin have the same
vertical offsets. However, the -dev xcairo results for the two cases
are quite different with the plbox result having much too large a
vertical offset for the superscript.  Starting superscript offset
level is off by 1 for plbox?

Implement infrastructure for bounding-box calculation for plbox,
label_box, and label_box_custom (including decorations such as
inverted tick marks and numerical tick labels).  Use this
infrastructure to help calculate the position of the complete colorbar
(including decorations) and its bounding box.  For now, the revised
example 33 shows the effects of inverted tick marks on position and
bounding box of the complete colorbar.

ToDo: for now, I have only implemented and tested the inverted tick
mark case as a proof of concept for the plbox bounding-box
infrastructure.  Thus, additional work needs to be done to include the
numerical tick labels in the bounding box for plbox.  Also, the
colorbar label (if present) is independent of plbox so must be
included independently into the bounding box calculation for the
complete colorbar.

Smaller cap angles imply large caps which are great for debugging cap
position problems, but as far as I know those are all debugged now so
return cap_angle to a larger cap_angle.  I have currently chosen that
to be 90 deg, but we may want to make the cap angle a bit smaller than
that if people prefer a slightly larger cap style.  Or we may want
to make this style parameter something that the user can set.

Adjust label_offset inside plcolorbar to account for exact cap extent.

API change for plcolorbar that adds functionality that is already
available in pllegend.  New arguments to return bounding box size
of colorbar, specify a background color for the area contained by the
bounding box (if the PL_COLORBAR_BACKGROUND bit is set in opt), and
specify the line color and line style of a boundary line for the
bounding box (if the PL_COLORBAR_BOUNDING_BOX bit is set in opt).

Add internal infrastructure to support complete position functionality
that is the same (except for defaults) as already implemented in
pllegend.  

ToDo: the new position functionality is a work in progress with some
remaining coordinate transformation issues so, for example, the size
of the bounding box is currently only correct in the simplest cases,
the bounding box is not yet plotted in the correct place, and the caps
are also not yet plotted in the correct place with the correct size. 
But the 16th and 33rd examples do build without errors and run (using
the -colorbar option) without showstopper errors such as segfaults.

Move from uncrustify 0.56 to 0.58.

For this new version of uncrustify, we have regenerated
uncrustify.cfg using the following commands:

uncrustify -c uncrustify.cfg --update-config-with-doc > new_config_file
mv new_config_file uncrustify.cfg

0.58 does more complete processing of spaces inside casts than
was done for 0.56.  So the vast majority of these source-code changes
involve inserting spaces inside casts where none appeared before.
e.g., (void*) ==> (void *) to be consistent with how, e.g., void *
is styled for spacing outside casts.

The remaining source code changes are almost entirely due to improved
alignment processing for 0.58.

Force removal of any spaces between pointer stars.  (i.e., "* *" ==>

no source code changes).  However, this change is needed for when (in
the immediate future) we move to uncrustify-0.58 to work around an
issue (all "**" instances were being changed to "* *" inside casts)
for that version of uncrustify.

(now reserved for specifying only the position of the colorbar) and other
characteristics of the plcolorbar result.

There is still a lot of work I have planned for plcolorbar. First on
that agenda is to use the same positioning logic as is used for
pllegend.  This planned change is only possible because of the prior
work of removing the cross-talk mentioned above.

Control whether edges of colorbar box and caps are drawn using the
PL_COLORBAR_(NOEDGE, EDGE) opt bits.  The default is 
PL_COLORBAR_NOEDGE.  For usage where the background color is not
included in the color range (such as example 33) PL_COLORBAR_NOEDGE
makes a nicer looking result.  For usage where the background colour
is included in the color range (such as example 16) PL_COLORBAR_EDGE
makes a nicer looking result.

Put the orientation of the colorbar directly under the control of the
user with the PL_COLORBAR_ORIENT_(RIGHT, TOP, LEFT, BOTTOM) orientation bits of
opt.  However, if the user does not specify any of these bits, then adopt
a sensible orientation default which depends on position.

Make all previous orientation logic (which was controlled strictly by
position bits before) depend on the orientation bits instead.

There are no changes to the example 33 PostScript results due to these 
internal changes (because of the default orientation choice noted
above).

ToDo: My goal here is that position should control nothing except
overall position of colorbar with no cross-talk with how that colorbar
object is specified except for the default value of the orientation. 
I have only dealt with the obvious orientation stuff for now and there
is some non-position logic (e.g., label offsets, numerical label
positions, and tick marks for the colorbar) that currently depends on
position bits that still must be dealt with to achieve my goal.

development.

First pass at a custom OCaml wrapper for pllegend

The biggest simplification is moving most parameters to optional arguments,

Move to the "//" style of commentary for D as well.  This change
brings our D commentary style into line with the commentary style of
our C and C++ code.

For a few of the D examples (e.g., x24d.d) I had to remove "\" escapes
at the end of commentary lines in order to get
scripts/convert_comment.py (called by scripts/style_source.sh) to
convert the comments correctly.

Fix long-standing typographical error in LGPL licensing terms that has
propagated to many of our files. Early in the license paragraph we
incorrectly referred to the "GNU General Library Public License"
(there is no such thing as the GNU GLPL) which has now been changed to
the correct terminology "GNU Library General Public License" instead. 
This change is consistent with how we refer to the license later in
the licensing paragraph.

CMake-2.8.4 (and prior versions of 2.8.x?) has a bug where ctests are
done in arbitrary order rather than in the order of the add_test
commands.  According to cmake mailing lists remarks, this bug will be
fixed in 2.8.5.  However, from the results of this bug the
examples_compare test was done first which reminded me that test
depends on other tests to prepare the files that are needed.
Therefore, I have put in that inter-test dependency via the DEPENDS
property you can set with set_tests_properties for cmake-2.8.x (but
not cmake-2.6.x which requires some extra cmake version logic).  That
change works around the arbitrary ordering bug for cmake-2.8.4 and is
a good idea on general principles (say if someone ever wanted to try
to get parallel ctests to work).

Implement much-improved file and target dependencies for the
generation of doxygen documentation.  This means changes to the
(ungenerated) source files will now cause the expected rebuild of the
doxygen documentation. Furthermore, the additional library target
dependencies assure that the doxygen documentation is built after the
libraries that generate source files as part of their build so that
the generated source files needed by doxygen will be available for the
doxygen documentation build. Note that run-time generated source
files are necessarily missing from the file dependencies generated at
cmake time so that the doxygen documentation will not be rebuilt after
one of the file prerequisites of the run-time generated source files
is changed.  However, such changes are fortunately rare in practice.

Tidy up plplot API.

Remove plParseOpts, plHLS_RGB, plRGB_HLS, plarrows which were all in src/pldeprecated.c and have been marked for deletion for some time.

Move plrgb, plrgb1 and plhls which are marked as obsolete and not to be used into src/pldeprecated.c to formally deprecate them. The functions in pldeprecated.c are now wrapped with #ifdef PL_DEPRECATED statements. Add -DPL_DEPRECATED=ON to the cmake command line to enable support for these.

Remove the compatibility macros for plcol, plpage, plclr, plcontf, Alloc2dGrid, Free2dGrid, MinMax2dGrid, plP_gvpd, plP_gvpw, plotsh3d. These versions have been hanging around for a long time and are marked as obsolete.

Update bindings to remove mentions of the above. For C, C++, f77, f90 the deprecated functions are #ifdef'd out. For swig generated langauges the support was already disabled. For ada it is commented out in the code.

Update plplot code and examples to remove all mentions of plcol, plrgb, plrgb1, plhls, plParseOpt.

Update documentation accordingly.

Revert recent changes to c++ examples by AWI. In C++ there is a saner way of dealing with the const 2-d array case in the C++ bindings so non-constant arrays can be automatically cast as const. This avoids explicit code changes for C++ examples, while still getting the benefits of using const.

Use const modifier on all Matrix (other than **OutMatrixCk) variants
and Array variants.  

Make java bindings and examples work with "const" changes. According
to swig documentation const is ignored with searching for the correct
typemap rule _except_ for composite typemaps which must include all
modifiers to get a match.

However, use const modifier for all (e.g., java in this commit)
typemaps to improve clarity for what is matched.

For java case correct jni, jtype, jstype, javain, and javaout typemaps
to a consistent identifier for the (PLFLT *ArrayX, PLINT nx) and
(const PLFLT *ArrayY, PLINT ny) composite typemaps. Also update
typedef for fill_func to be consistent with const plfill arguments.

The result of these changes is java now works again and generates
results that are consistent with the C results.  Therefore, enable
java by default again.

Changes to our C/C++ API to use the const modifier on all input

some reason.  There was no such requirement for one-dimensional arrays.

Disable swig-generated bindings by default since those don't work
(yet) for this changed API.

warning messages which still need to be cleaned up) using the
test_diff_psc target in the build tree.

Update C and python versions of example 27 so that fills work correctly
both for -eofill (even-odd fill) and with that option dropped
(non-zero winding rule fill).

All the previous fill issues for self-intersecting boundaries were an
artifact of the incorrect angle termination condition (via windings).
The correct windings must be calculated such that _both_ phi and phiw
are the minimum possible integer multiple of 2 pi.  It is easy to show
that this condition leads to windings = params[1]/gcd(params[0],
params[1]) (with appropriate adjustments to convert to integers and
use absolute values).

With this change to the maximum phi and phiw, the results look
beautiful for both -eofill and not.  

I ascribe the previous bad filling results for the -eofill case as due
to the boundaries of certain areas being duplicated an even number of
times (which reverses the decision about whether a given area will be
filled or not for the even-odd fill rule).  I ascribe the previous
slightly bad fill results for the non-zero winding number fill rule
to the last large boundary segment that was required to close the
boundary for the previous case.

A side benefit of no longer using an excessive number of windings is
that NPTS can be divided by 10 and yet still have a smooth result.

I also changed the xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax logic so that it worked
reliably for all cases.

For the python case I also took advantage of numpy array capabilities.

The resulting C and python results are consistent.  Please propagate
these windings, NPT, and min/max changes to all other languages.

Attempt to make the basic mode of the wxwidgets device honor the
-eofill option.  With -drvopt backend=0 (basic mode), I have traced
the calls to insure that with -eofill DrawPolygon is called with
wxODDEVEN_RULE, and without the -eofill option, DrawPolygon is called
with wxWINDING_RULE.  According to the documentation of DrawPolygon at
http://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_d_c.html#f3ded6183d3ba706d0377e5c25fcaf83
those two separate calls should generate different filled results for
example 27, but there must be a bug in the wxwidgets library because
the results are always the same corresponding to -eofill for -dev
xwin. That is, it appears that wxWINDING_RULE is always ignored for
DrawPolygon, and the default wxODDEVEN_RULE always used instead.

So the current status is the basic mode always handles fills with the
even-odd fill rule regardless of what is specified with -eofill
because of this wxwidgets library bug while the wxGC mode honors the
-eofill rule with the two different kinds of fills.

Implement the -eofill option.  If this option is used, then for the
case where the boundary of the filled region is self-intersecting
(e.g., example 27), use the even-odd fill rule rather than the default
nonzero fill rule.  Note, PLplot current relies on drivers (or the
library dependencies of drivers) to implement fills so it is up
to the drivers to honor this option.

ToDo. Get xwin, svg, cairo, and qt device drivers to honor this option.

Fix up some more of the PL_MAXPOLY logic. This change allows fills for

N.B. There is still more PL_MAXPOLY work to do for the plr_line
routine in plt.c.  The issue there is the code is so complicated it is
difficult (for me, at least) to figure out how much memory needs to be
allocated.  Fortunately, this accident waiting to happen does not seem
to be triggered by our current examples.

Change XFillPolygon shape argument from Nonconvex to Complex since the
latter is required for possibily self-intersecting boundaries (as
occurs for example 27) according to the XFillPolygon man page.  In fact,
the man page says the fill results are undefined for self-intersecting
boundaries if you use the incorrect Nonconvex shape argument rather
than the correct Complex one.

This change made no difference to the rendering errors that occur for
example 27 for either the normal WindingRule fill rule or if that is
changed to the EvenOddRule fill rule.  Nevertheless, I am making this
change to be in conformance with the requirement as set out in the man
page and just in case it does make a difference for X server platforms
other than my Debian Squeeze one for Intel video hardware.

Replace drawConvexPolygon with drawPolygon.  This fixes a -dev qtwidget
bug for example 27 which has complex (i.e., not convex) boundaries for
the filled polygons that are plotted.

Use Qt::WindingFill fill rule rather than the (default)
Qt::OddEvenFill fill rule.  This makes a major difference for the
example 27 fill results. For some reason the former is implemented in
the Qt4 library in a much less buggy way than the latter.

N.B. the Qt::WindingFill fill rule is ignored by the svgqt device.
Instead, the resulting svg file has the incorrect oddeven fill
attribute.  This must be a bug in the Qt4 library implementation (at
least for the 4.6.3 Debian squeeze version of Qt4).

Note: in example 8 I ran into an oddity with the hexadecimal notation for MAG_COLOR. I had

to convert a string to a number. We should replace it with Tcl_GetInt() to take care of 
the alternative forms.

Previously we have assumed that plgvpd returned the the values of the

correct if there is more than one subpage per page.  To fix this issue
so that pllegend (and plcolorbar) give good results regardless of how
the page is divided into subpages, define a new (static) function
plgvpsp which always returns the values of the arguments of the last

The swig-generated bindings for octave are completely mature now, AFAIK.

Therefore, replace the ENABLE_swig_octave ON/OFF option with
ENABLE_matwrapped_octave OFF/ON option with the default being
ENABLE_matwrapped_octave=OFF.

Emphasize that ENABLE_matwrapped_octave=ON is a legacy alternative
that is not going to be around for much longer (my guess is we will
probably drop it just after the next release).

Corrections in example 33 for F77, (more or less) completed work on F95 binding for pllegend() and the
examples. They produce results that are identical to the C examples. 

The interface for F95 needs some tweaking: we do not want the nlegend argument and we need additional
checking of the arguments. This means example 4 will change a bit and the implementation of the interface will 
change (more sanity checking). Rationale: we want to take advantage of more Fortran 95 features.

Implementation of the Fortran 95 interface to pllegend. Extended example 4 with the
appropriate calls. No formal comparisons yet.

Note: the interface uses the nlegend arguments just as the C version. I could have 
used the size of the text argument to determine this, but that would have meant 
that the user has to select the right section, e.g. call pllegend(..., text(1:nlegend), ...)
to limit the number of entries. It would not have been as convenient as with the other
cases where a "size" argument is derived on the Fortran 95 side.

N.B. this does not cure the current broken default build but it
does not make it worse.

OTOH, the -DBUILD_TEST=ON -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON cmake options
and the make test_c_psc target do work with this change and
produce good-looking results.

ToDo: propagate this plcolorbar API change to the other languages so

Handle legend_text correctly so that results are consistent with

Also define symbols(1) since this makes valgrind happier during
the transformation of symbols(1) into a C string array which

N.B. Some changes made to the ocaml bindings as well, but I could not
figure it out/make it work so this change temporarily breaks ocaml

Preliminary implementation of pllegend for Fortran 77:
- We probably want to introduce a new include file, because of the PL_LEGEND_* constants.
  The alternative is to copy them into the source code for each example, as done now.
  (Note that we can solve this for Fortran 90/95 via the module, no need for an
  extra file here)
- The implementation now uses two extra static variables to convert the arrays of 
  strings to the C conventions. However, that is not thread-safe (it does avoid a 
  complication with passing the string lengths, though)
- Not checked against the C output yet. The other examples still need to be
  done.
- Only checked for gfortran.

N.B. This gives excellent results on Octave, but the separate file
approach may need further tweaking to work on Python.  It has been
a long time since I have looked at the Python generated help strings so
I may be doing something incorrectly, but
when I attempt to do that now using, e.g.,

pllegend.__doc__

Initial commit of perl script which parses doc/docbook/src/api.xml to

This perl script uses much of the code in api2text.xml to collect the

transform that xml information into a form acceptable by swig, and
output all results into one file rather than a series of files.

Clean up which examples will be run for the swig-generated case and
the (deprecated) matwrapped case.

1.  Run the same "p" examples in both cases.

2.  Do not run x19c.m or x32c.m for both cases (since those examples not
implemented, yet).

3.  Aside from those dropped in 2., run all x??c.m examples for the
swig-generated case.

4.  Aside from those dropped in 2., also drop x04c.m, x18c.m, x26c.m,
and x33c.m for the (deprecated) matwrapped case because plstring,
plstring3, pllegend, and plcolorbar not implemented in that case.

With these rules imposed, the test_diff_psc target results had no
obvious errors for both the swig-generated and matwrapped cases.

Add example 33 to the octave examples that are tested in the

C results.  N.B. example 33 is deliberately kept off of the list of

the array of strings (char **) type of arguments that occur for
pllegend.

Initial commit of 33rd example for octave.  This runs without issues
from a hand-configured octave environment (to take care of global
variable issues) for -dev xwin and gives results that are
indistinguishable by eye from the C -dev xwin results for this
example.  However, there is some malformed UTF-8 evident for
unicode-aware devices like -dev psc.  The error message is

*** PLPLOT ERROR, ABORTING OPERATION ***
UTF-8 string is malformed: � aborting operation

repeated often.  That issue obviously still needs to be sorted out.

After that dealing with global variable issues must be automated
(using the recently updated plplot_octave_def file), and test scripts
adjusted to test example 33 with octave to make sure when all
corrections are completed it is giving the same results as the
corresponding C example.

This defines _many_ more global constants for octave than previously
in an automated way.  This should be a substantial improvement to
the current matwrapped bindings for octave, and soon plplot_octave_def
will also be used by the swig-generated bindings for octave to
make global PLplot variables accessible to octave.

Kill trailing blanks in strings that are padded out to the longest
length in the matrix by the charMatrix class.  This, of course, gets rid
of legitimate trailing blanks (if those ever occur), but this is a
constraint imposed by the charMatrix class, and this seems the best
compromise for dealing with it.

Implement proof of concept (with a test function, testppchar) of how
to deal with Octave character arrays as arguments. This should prove
useful for bindings of pllegend and plstripc (currently handled in a
clumsy way by wrapping with a function that takes four character
string arguments rather than one argument of a characer array
containing four strings).

Currently the char **ArrayCk typemap only handles the charMatrix case
(an ordinary Octave matrix filled with strings that have been extended
with blanks so they all have the same length).  Additional logic to
detect the cell matrix case and deal separately with it should be
implemented as well.  Also, logic to handle other error conditions
should be implemented.  But the current typemap should be good enough
to get all the pllegend-using examples to work for now using the
non-cell character matrix case.

Custom labeling goes with shade color bars.  If a user wants, labels and

Implement a flexible scheme for dealing with large polygons: instead of accepting only polygons
of moderate size (defined by PL_MAXPOLY) the functions involved now either use small statically
defined arrays if the polygon is small enough or allocate arrays of an appropriate size that 
later get freed again. It should therefore no longer matter how large the polygons are.

Note: not all source code has been compiled and the current tests do not involve such large
polygons. The "ordinary" case, small polygons, has been tested though.

Initial steps toward a plcolorbar implementation

The eventual plan is to use this function to support color bars for plimage,
plshades and possibly plgradient.

At this point, plimage is partially supported.  Support for plshades and
plgradient are next on my TODO list.

- The position of the color bar can be specified relative to any one of the
  four sides of the plot sub-page.
- The length and width of the color bar are specified by the user.
- An array with a high and low value can be passed, which will result in
  a plimage-based color bar with automatically-interpolated steps between
  the low and high values.
- A label can be drawn on a user-specified side of the color bar
- End-caps can be drawn on either end of the color bar
- Two new pages have been added to example 33, illustrating some basic
  functionality.

This requires a lot of testing, particularly the various combinations of
color bar position, label positions and inclusion/exclusion of end caps.

Initial commit of swig-generated bindings for Octave.

N.B. these bindings are ignored and the traditional matwrap-generated
bindings used by default unless the user specifies
-DENABLE_swig_octave=ON.

The only tests run so far with -DENABLE_swig_octave=ON on the Linux
platform are the plplot_octave target builds
bindings/octave/plplot_octave.oct and the ldd -r result on
plplot_octave.oct is identical to that for the traditional
matwrap-bindings (except for the index numbers for each library).

Further planned tests are to see if the standard octave example 10
works with these new bindings, and if so, try all the same tests on
the wine version of Windows.

Make determination of Octave version a little more proof against

However, the new logic cannot give a soft landing for internal octave
errors as occurs, for example, on wine.

automatical buffer overflow unless the limit is changed back to what

Change internal truncation limit for filename length returned by

to solve this issue with a plgfnam API change instead (see discussion

appear to work with the examples that have recently been changed

completely separate locations for the build-tree and installed
examples tree cases.  It is absolutely necessary to set the PATH since
examples/tcl/x?? executes pltcl directly (unless you want to configure
all of those files), but limit the scope of PATH setting only to
test_tcl.sh where it is needed to find pltcl.

This implementation actually works on Linux (unlike the prior change
trying to address pltcl finding issues which introduced some Linux
bugs), and it is designed to work on Windows as well although it is
currently not tested there.

Tweak directions to set PLplot release version number of
doxygen-generated documentation.

Also, tweak directions to account for the important change in
scripts/generate_website.sh which copies all files under svn control
(including all local changes to those files) from the source tree that
includes that script.  This change, means for example, that as a
matter of convenience the release manager (or anybody else) does not
have to commit local changes in order to generate and test the
website based on those local changes.

Update to template doxygen configuration file generated by doxygen
1.7.1.  Mostly this involves commentary tweaks or new configuration
options (where I have just accepted the default).

I have edited this file to minimize changes on the existing
configuration parameters of the old file except for the
following important changes:

-OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C  = YES
+OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C  = NO
(NO recommended if have more than just C code which we do.)

-EXTRACT_ALL            = NO

-EXTRACT_STATIC         = NO
+EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES
(YES recommended for all three by the IBM article on doxygen.  The
result is there is an attempt to document [at least by default]
as much of our code as possible which I believe is a good thing to
do.)

Implement plstring which is designed to supersede plsymbol and plpoin
when the glyph(s) you want to plot at each of the points can be expressed
with a standard user input string.  As with plmtex or plptex the
standard input string can be UTF-8, or the ascii subset of UTF-8, or
one of the standard PLplot text escape sequences.

N.B. the use of plstring highlights that there are some vertical
alignment issues with plptex (which is called internally by plstring)
depending on the device driver that is being used.

Change the API of pllegend to express the symbols (glyphs) used for
each legend entry as a standard user input string (which allows
pllegend to call plstring internally).

Change the 4th and 26th example to use this new pllegend API and to
also use plstring to plot the line in the non-legend part of the plot.
Also, make the legend background colour more transparent (alpha
changed from 0.90 to 0.70).

Ignore all instances of a string (such as "/*") being searched for on
a line where the first such instance is quoted.  

This rule obviously is not a completely general solution of all the
potential problems associated with quotes, but it gets the job done
for one of the lib files where this turned out to be important. Also,
a search for bad combinations of '//' and '"' in the resulting lib
results (as well as the historical src and include results) showed
no issues.

ToDo: So far we have only converted C code in src and include to the

we still have lots more C and C++ code (e.g., in lib, bindings,
drivers, and examples) that needs to be changed to the new commentary

the Hershey font case.

Document origin of Greek (#g) symbols (especially epsilon, theta, and phi
where an out-of order Hershey index is used to designate the glyph). This
means (ever since the dawn of PLplot history as checked for version
5.1.0 [!] of PLplot) that #ge, #gh, and #gf
escapes give users the Greek lunate epsilon, the ordinary lower case
theta (as opposed to the Greek symbol theta = script theta), and the
Greek symbol phi _in the Hershey font case_.

Limit pllegend to just Python for now since more work is required to get
the Java (and Lua?) bindings to build with pllegend.
