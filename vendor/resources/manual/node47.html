pladv, plbin, API, API

<P>
pladv(sub)
<A NAME="pladv">&#160;</A>pladv

<P>
Advances to the next subpage if sub=0, performing a page
advance if there are no remaining subpages on the current page.  If
subwindowing isn't being used, pladv(0) will always advance the
page.  If sub&gt;0, PLplot switches to the specified subpage.  Note
that this allows you to overwrite a plot on the specified subpage; if this
is not what you intended, use plclr followed by plpage to
first advance the page.  This routine is called automatically (with
sub=0) by plenv, but if plenv is not used,
pladv must be called after initializing PLplot but before defining
the viewport.

<P>
sub (PLINT, input)Specifies the subpage number (starting from
1 in the top left corner and increasing along the rows) to which to advance.
Set to zero to advance to the next subpage.

<P>
plbin, plbox, pladv, API

<P>
plbin(nbin, x, y, cen)
<A NAME="plbin">&#160;</A>plbin

<P>
Plots a histogram consisting of n bins.  The value associated
with the i'th bin is placed in x[i], and the number of points in
the bin is placed in y[i].  For proper operation, the values in
x[i] must form a strictly increasing sequence.  If center is
false,  x[i] is the left-hand edge of the i'th bin, and if
center is true, the bin boundaries are placed midway between the
values in the x array.  Also see plhist for drawing
histograms from unbinned data.

<P>
nbin (PLINT, input)Number of bins (i.e., number of values in
<I>x</I> and <I>y</I> arrays.)

<P>
x (PLFLT *, input)Pointer to array containing values
associated with bins.  These must form a strictly increasing sequence.

<P>
y (PLFLT *, input)Pointer to array containing number of
points in bin.  This is a PLFLT (instead of PLINT) array so as to allow
histograms of probabilities, etc.

<P>
cen (PLINT, input)Indicates whether the values in x
represent the lower bin boundaries (cen=0) or whether the bin
boundaries are to be midway between the x values (cen=1).  If
the values in x are equally spaced and cen=1, the values in
x are the center values of the bins.

<P>
plbox(xopt, xtick, nxsub, yopt, ytick, nysub)
<A NAME="plbox">&#160;</A>plbox

<P>
Draws a box around the currently defined viewport, and labels it
with world coordinate values appropriate to the window.  Thus plbox
should only be called after defining both viewport and window.  The
character strings xopt and yopt specify how the box should be
drawn as described below.  If ticks and/or subticks are to be drawn for a
particular axis, the tick intervals and number of subintervals may be
specified explicitly, or they may be defaulted by setting the appropriate
arguments to zero.

<P>
xopt (char *, input)Pointer to character string specifying
options for horizontal axis.  The string can include any combination of the
following letters (upper or lower case) in any order:

g: Draws a grid at the major tick interval.

<P>
<LI>
i: Inverts tick marks, so they are drawn outwards, rather than
inwards.

<P>
<LI>
l: Labels axis logarithmically.  This only affects the labels,
not the data, and so it is necessary to compute the logarithms of data
points before passing them to any of the drawing routines.

unconventional location (above box for X, right of box for Y).

<P>

order to use any of the other options.

<P>
<LI>
i: Inverts tick marks, so they are drawn downwards, rather than
upwards.

<P>
<LI>
l: Labels axis logarithmically.  This only affects the labels, 
not the data, and so it is necessary to compute the logarithms of data
points before passing them to any of the drawing routines.

text label for the x axis.  It is only drawn if u is in the xopt
string.

ticks on the x axis.  If it is set to zero, PLplot automatically generates a
suitable tick interval.

<P>
nxsub (PLINT, input)Number of subintervals between major

<P>
<LI>
c: Draws z axis to the right of the surface plot.

<P>
<LI>

These lines are not drawn until after plot3d or plmesh are called
because of the need for hidden line removal.

<P>
<LI>
i: Inverts tick marks, so they are drawn away from the center.

<P>
<LI>
l: Labels axis logarithmically.  This only affects the labels, 
not the data, and so it is necessary to compute the logarithms of data
points before passing them to any of the drawing routines.

verical axis.

<P>
<LI>

plpage()
<A NAME="plpage">&#160;</A>plpage

<P>
Begins a new page.  For a file driver, the output file is opened if
necessary.  Advancing the page via plclr and plpage is useful
when a page break is desired at a particular point when plotting to
subpages.  Another use for plclr and plpage is when plotting
pages to different files, since you can manually set the file name (or file
handle) by calling plsfnam or plsfile after the call to
plclr (in fact some drivers may only support a single page per
file, making this a necessity).  One way to handle this case automatically
is to page advance via pladv, but enable familying (see
plsfam) with a small byte per file limit so that a new family
member file will be created on each page break.

<P>
Except for one of these circumstances, it is best to advance the page or
subpage simply by the call pladv(0).

one device is enabled when PLplot is installed, plstar will issue no
prompt.  The output device is divided into nx by ny sub-pages,
each of which may be used independently.  The subroutine pladv is used
to advance from one subpage to the next.

<P>
nx (PLINT, input)Number of subpages to divide output page in
the horizontal direction.

<P>
ny (PLINT, input)Number of subpages to divide output page in
the vertical direction.

<P>
plstart, plstyl, plstar, API

<P>
plstart(device, nx, ny)
<A NAME="plstart">&#160;</A>plstart

<P>
Alternative to plstar for initializing the plotting package.
The device name keyword for the desired output device must be supplied as an
argument.  The device keywords are the same as those printed out by
plstar.  If the requested device is not available, or if the input
string is empty or begins with ``?'', the prompted startup of
plstar is used.  This routine also divides the output device into
nx by ny sub-pages, each of which may be used independently.  The
subroutine pladv is used to advance from one subpage to the next.

<P>
device (char *, input)Device name (keyword) of the required
output device.  If NULL or if the first character is a ``?'', the normal
(prompted) startup is used.

<P>
nx (PLINT, input)Number of subpages to divide output page in
the horizontal direction.

<P>
ny (PLINT, input)Number of subpages to divide output page in
the vertical direction.

<P>
plstyl, plsvpa, plstart, API

<P>
plstyl(nels, mark, space)
<A NAME="plstyl">&#160;</A>plstyl

<P>
This sets up the line style for all lines subsequently drawn.  A
line consists of segments in which the pen is alternately down and up.
The lengths of these segments are passed in the arrays mark and
space respectively.  The number of mark-space pairs is specified by
nels.  In order to return the line style to the default continuous
line,  plstyl should be called with nels=0.(also see
pllsty) 

<P>
nels (PLINT, input)The number of mark and space
elements in a line.  Thus a simple broken line can be obtained by setting
nels=1.  A continuous line is specified by setting nels=0.

<P>
mark (PLINT *, input)Pointer to array with the lengths of
the segments during which the pen is down, measured in micrometers.

<P>
space (PLINT *, input)Pointer to array with the lengths of
the segments during which the pen is up, measured in micrometers.

<P>
plsvpa(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
<A NAME="plsvpa">&#160;</A>plsvpa

<P>
Alternate routine to plvpor for setting up the viewport.  This
routine should be used only if the viewport is required to have a definite
size in millimeters.  The routine plgspa is useful for finding out the
size of the current subpage.  

<P>
xmin (PLFLT, input)The distance of the left-hand edge of the
viewport from the left-hand edge of the subpage in millimeters.

<P>
xmax (PLFLT, input)The distance of the right-hand edge of the
viewport from the left-hand edge of the subpage in millimeters.

<P>

plsxax, plsyax, plsvpa, API

<P>
plsxax(digmax, digits)
<A NAME="plsxax">&#160;</A>plsxax

<P>
Returns current values of the digmax and digits flags
for the x axis.  digits is updated after the plot is drawn, so so this
routine should only be called <EM>after</EM> the call to plbox 
(or plbox3) is complete.  Annotation for more information.

<P>
digmax (PLINT, output)Variable to set the maximum
number of digits.  If nonzero, the printed label will be switched to a
floating point representation when the number of digits exceeds
digmax.

<P>
digits (PLINT, input)Field digits value.  Currently, changing
its value here has no effect since it is set only by plbox or
plbox3.  However, the user may obtain its value after a call to
plbox by calling plgxax.

<P>
plsyax, plsym, plsxax, API

<P>
plsyax(digmax, digits)
<A NAME="plsyax">&#160;</A>plsyax

<P>
Identical to plsxax, except that arguments are flags for 
y axis.  See the description of plsxax for more detail.

<P>
plsym, plszax, plsyax, API

<P>
plsym(n, x, y, code)
<A NAME="plsym">&#160;</A>plsym

<P>
Marks out a set of n points at positions (x[i], y[i]), 
using the symbol defined by code.  The code is interpreted as an index
in the Hershey font tables.

<P>
n (PLINT, input)Number of points to be marked.

<P>
x (PLFLT *, input)Pointer to array with set of x coordinate
values for the points.

<P>
y (PLFLT *, input)Pointer to array with set of y coordinate
values for the points.

<P>
code (PLINT, input)Code number for the symbol to be plotted.

<P>
plszax, pltext, plsym, API

<P>
plszax(digmax, digits)
<A NAME="plszax">&#160;</A>plszax

<P>
Identical to plsxax, except that arguments are flags for 
z axis.  See the description of plsxax for more detail.

<P>
pltext, plvasp, plszax, API

<P>
pltext()
<A NAME="pltext">&#160;</A>pltext

<P>
Sets an interactive device to text mode, used in conjunction with
plgra to allow graphics and text to be interspersed.  On a device
which supports separate text and graphics windows, this command causes
control to be switched to the text window.  This can be useful for printing
diagnostic messages or getting user input, which would otherwise interfere
with the plots.  The user <EM>must</EM> switch back to the graphics window
before issuing plot commands, as the text (or console) device will probably
become quite confused otherwise.  If already in text mode, this command is
ignored.  It is also ignored on devices which only support a single window
or use a different method for shifting focus (also plgra).

<P>
plvasp, plvpas, pltext, API

<P>
plvasp(aspect)
<A NAME="plvasp">&#160;</A>plvasp

<P>
plvpas(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, aspect)
<A NAME="plvpas">&#160;</A>plvpas

<P>
Device-independent routine for setting up the viewport.  The
viewport is chosen to be the largest with the given aspect ratio that fits
within the specified region (in terms of normalized subpage coordinates).
This routine is functionally equivalent to plvpor when a ``natural''
aspect ratio (0.0) is chosen.  Unlike plvasp, this routine reserves
no extra space at the edges for labels.

left-hand edge of the viewport.

<P>
xmax (PLFLT, input)The normalized subpage coordinate of the
right-hand edge of the viewport.

bottom edge of the viewport.

<P>
ymax (PLFLT, input)The normalized subpage coordinate of the
top edge of the viewport.

<P>
aspect (PLFLT, input)Ratio of length of y axis to length of x
axis.

<P>
plvpor(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
<A NAME="plvpor">&#160;</A>plvpor

<P>
Device-independent routine for setting up the viewport.  This
defines the viewport in terms of normalized subpage coordinates which run
from 0.0 to 1.0 (left to right and bottom to top) along each edge of the
current subpage.  Use the alternate routine plsvpa in order to create
a viewport of a definite size.

character heights, and four character heights around the other three sides.

<P>
plw3d, plwid, plvsta, API

<P>
plw3d(basex, basey, height, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax, alt, az)
<A NAME="plw3d">&#160;</A>plw3d

<P>
Sets up a window for a three-dimensional surface plot within the
currently defined two-dimensional window.  The enclosing box for the surface
plot defined by xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin
and zmax in user-coordinate space is mapped into a box of world
coordinate size basex by basey by height so that
xmin maps to -basex/2, xmax maps to basex/2,
ymin maps to -basey/2, ymax maps to basey/2,
zmin maps to 0 and zmax maps to height.  The
resulting world-coordinate box is then viewed by an observer at altitude
alt and azimuth az.  This routine must be called before
plbox3 or plot3d.  For a more complete description of
three-dimensional plotting 3-d Plots.
